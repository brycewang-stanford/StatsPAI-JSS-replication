"""Stata → StatsPAI / R → StatsPAI command translators.

Public surface
--------------

* :func:`from_stata` — translate a Stata command string to a ready-to-
  dispatch ``{tool, arguments, python_code, notes}`` dict.
* :func:`from_r` — same shape, for R / fixest / felm / did syntax.

The translators are exposed as MCP tools so an agent can hand a user's
Stata or R snippet directly to the server and receive a verified
StatsPAI call back. The output carries both:

* ``python_code`` — a runnable string the agent can paste into a chat
  reply (``sp.feols("y ~ x | id", data=df, cluster="id")`` — fixed effects
  live inside the pyfixest formula, since ``sp.feols`` is the real callable).
* ``tool_call`` — a JSON-RPC-ready ``{tool, arguments}`` payload the
  agent can dispatch via ``tools/call`` to actually run the
  translation.

Failure modes are non-fatal: an unrecognised command returns
``{tool: null, error: "...", suggestions: [...]}`` rather than
raising. Calls translate one command at a time — multi-command
``do`` files should be split by the caller.

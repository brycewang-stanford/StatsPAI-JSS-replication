"""Error -> actionable-fix registry for agent self-repair loops.

Given a Python exception raised from a StatsPAI tool call, ``remediate()``
returns a structured suggestion the agent can use to repair its next
attempt.  The registry covers the most common failure modes seen in
practice:

- Missing columns / typos
- Non-binary treatment / wrong dtype
- Too few observations per cohort
- Identification blockers from ``strict=True`` mode
- Formula-parse errors
- Missing dependencies (sklearn, matplotlib, ...)

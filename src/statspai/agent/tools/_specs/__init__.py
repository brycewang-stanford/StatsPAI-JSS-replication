"""Aggregate every per-family spec list into the single ``TOOL_REGISTRY``.

The hand-curated tools are intentionally split by causal-inference
family (regression / DID / IV / RD / matching / diagnostics /
orchestrators) so each file stays small and reviewable. Adding a new
hand-curated tool: drop a dict into the matching family file (or
create a new family file + add it here).

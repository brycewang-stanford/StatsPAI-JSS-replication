Policy Learning: Optimal treatment assignment from heterogeneous effects.

Learns an interpretable treatment assignment policy that maximises
the expected welfare (value) of the population. Given estimated CATE,
finds the optimal tree-based policy: "who should be treated?"

Components
----------
- **PolicyTree** : Optimal depth-limited decision tree for treatment
  assignment (Athey & Wager 2021).
- **policy_value** : Evaluate the expected value of a treatment policy
  using doubly robust scores.

"""Pre-trend equivalence testing (Liu, Wang & Xu 2024).

A failure to reject "no pre-trend" is not evidence that pre-trends are absent —
it is often just low power, which is Roth's (2022) point. The counterfactual-
estimator literature answers this by *reversing the null*: instead of testing
whether pre-period effects are zero, test whether they are demonstrably
**small**. That is what R ``fect``'s diagnostic panel reports, and it is the
current standard for validating parallel trends in TSCS designs.

Three statistics, all ported from ``fect:::diagtest``:

``f_stat`` / ``f_pvalue``
    The conventional joint test that every pre-period effect is zero.
    ``psi = D' S^-1 D`` scaled by ``(N_bar - k) / ((N_bar - 1) k)`` and
    referred to ``F(k, N_bar - k)``. A small p-value says the pre-trend is
    detectable; a large one says only that it was not detected.

``f_equivalence_pvalue``
    The same statistic read against a *non-central* ``F`` with non-centrality
    ``N_bar * f_threshold``. Here a **small** p-value is the reassuring
    outcome: it rejects the null that the pre-trend is at least as large as
    the threshold.

``tost_pvalue``
    Two one-sided tests per pre-period against ``±tost_threshold``, taking the
    least favourable (maximum) p-value across periods. Again, small is
    reassuring: it rejects "at least one pre-period effect is bigger than the
    threshold".

Because the equivalence tests invert the usual logic, the threshold is a
substantive judgement about what counts as a negligible pre-trend. The
dimensionless ``f_threshold`` carries ``fect``'s 0.6 default; the TOST
threshold is in outcome units and has no defensible universal default, so it
must be supplied — omitting it reports the F tests and leaves TOST as ``None``
rather than inventing a scale.

Verified against R ``fect`` 2.4.1: on identical inputs the F statistic,
its p-value and the TOST p-value match to ~1e-15, and the non-central F
equivalence p-value to ~2e-10 (SciPy vs R's non-central F).

    ----------
    pre_estimates
        Pre-period event-study coefficients, excluding the normalised
        reference period.
    pre_cov
        Their joint covariance matrix. The *joint* covariance is what makes
        the F test valid; a diagonal built from the standard errors would
        ignore the (substantial) cross-period correlation.
    n_bar
        Number of treated units contributing to the pre-periods. This enters
        the finite-sample scaling and the non-centrality parameter.
    pre_se
        Per-period standard errors used by the TOST. Defaults to
        ``sqrt(diag(pre_cov))``.
    f_threshold
        Dimensionless effect-size bound for the F equivalence test
        (``fect``'s default is 0.6).
    tost_threshold
        Equivalence bound in **outcome units**. Required for the TOST; when

    event_times
        Optional labels, carried through for reporting.

    Answers the question a plain pre-trend test cannot: *is the pre-trend
    demonstrably small*, as opposed to merely not detected? A failure to
    reject "no pre-trend" is frequently just low power (Roth 2022), so
    reporting it alone overstates the evidence for parallel trends.

    Needs the **joint** covariance of the pre-period event-study
    coefficients, which is recovered from a Callaway-Sant'Anna fit's
    influence functions. Results without influence functions cannot support
    the joint F test and raise rather than silently substituting a diagonal.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : CausalResult
        A DiD fit carrying an event study and influence functions (e.g.
        :func:`sp.callaway_santanna`).
    f_threshold : float, default 0.6
        Dimensionless effect-size bound for the F equivalence test
        (``fect``'s default).
    tost_threshold : float, optional
        Equivalence bound in outcome units. Without it the TOST is skipped —
        there is no defensible universal default for "how big a pre-trend is
        too big", and inventing one would be a substantive judgement made on
        the user's behalf. ``fect`` uses ``0.36 * residual SD``.
    alpha : float, default 0.05
        Level used by :meth:`EquivalenceResult.verdict`.

    Returns
    -------
    EquivalenceResult
        ``f_stat`` / ``f_pvalue`` (conventional joint test),
        ``f_equivalence_pvalue`` and ``tost_pvalue`` (equivalence tests,
        where *small* is the reassuring outcome), plus ``.verdict()``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import statspai as sp
    >>> df = sp.dgp_did(n_units=200, n_periods=8, staggered=True, seed=42)
    >>> df['first_treat'] = df['first_treat'].fillna(0)
    >>> cs = sp.callaway_santanna(df, y='y', g='first_treat', t='time', i='unit')
    >>> eq = sp.pretrends_equivalence(cs)
    >>> 0.0 <= eq.f_pvalue <= 1.0
    True
    >>> isinstance(eq.verdict(), str)
    True

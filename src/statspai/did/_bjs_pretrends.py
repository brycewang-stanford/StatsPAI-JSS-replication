"""Reference-period conventions for imputation-DiD pre-trend coefficients.

An imputation estimator computes its **post**-treatment event-study
coefficients by averaging ``Y - Ŷ(0)`` over treated cells.  Its
**pre**-treatment coefficients are a separate construction, and the
construction is not the same in every implementation.  Roth (2026) shows
that the choice changes the shape of the plotted event study — a kink or a
jump can appear at the treatment date purely from the construction, with
no treatment effect and with parallel trends violated identically in every
period — so the visual heuristics that applied researchers carry over from
a dynamic TWFE event study do not transfer.

Three constructions are implemented here and in :func:`did_imputation`.

``"bjs"``
    The convention of Borusyak, Jaravel and Spiess (2024) as shipped in
    Stata ``did_imputation, pretrends(k)``.  Fit a dynamic TWFE regression
    on the **untreated** observations only, with lead indicators
    ``1{relative time = -1}, …, 1{relative time = -k}`` and *all earlier
    relative times pooled into the omitted category*.  In the
    non-staggered case this makes the pre-treatment coefficients
    long-differences against the earliest pre-period, while the
    post-treatment coefficients are differences against the *average* of
    all pre-periods — the asymmetry that produces Roth's jump.

``"in-sample"``
    The convention of the ``fect`` and ``did2s`` packages: report
    ``mean(Y - Ŷ(0))`` at pre-treatment relative times too.  Those are
    in-sample prediction errors, because the pre-treatment outcomes of
    eventually-treated units are themselves part of the training data.
    Li and Strezhnev (2025) show, and Roth (2026, appendix A) restates,
    that in the non-staggered case this shrinks the symmetric benchmark by
    exactly ``N0 / N`` — the untreated share of units — so it understates
    pre-trends, severely when most units are treated.

``"symmetric"``
    Roth's (2026) recommended repair, ``β̂^{BJS,new}``: use the average of
    the pre-treatment periods as the reference for *both* the pre- and the
    post-treatment coefficients.  In the non-staggered case the resulting
    path equals the dynamic TWFE event study up to one common vertical
    shift, so the usual visual heuristics apply again.  Note that the
    pre-treatment coefficients then average to zero by construction, so
    only the *relative* movement between coefficients is informative.

    """Pre-trend coefficients under the BJS / Stata ``did_imputation`` rule.

    ``weights_untreated`` are estimation weights on the untreated rows; the
    auxiliary regression is then weighted least squares with the
    cluster-robust sandwich built from ``omega_i x_i e_i`` scores, which is
    what row-scaling every matrix by ``sqrt(omega)`` before the unweighted
    algebra delivers.

    Runs the auxiliary dynamic TWFE regression on the untreated
    observations only.  ``design_untreated`` is the same Y(0) design the
    imputation step already built (intercept, fixed effects, controls), so
    the pre-trend regression inherits exactly the model the estimator
    imputes with, and the lead indicators are appended to it.

    Identification of the leads comes from the omitted category: every
    relative time earlier than ``min(leads)`` — plus every never-treated
    observation — stays in the reference group.  Requesting a lead for
    which no untreated observation survives is a caller error rather than
    a silently dropped column, and is reported as such.

    Parameters
    ----------
    design_untreated
        Sparse untreated design matrix, first column the intercept.
    y_untreated
        Outcome on the untreated rows.
    rel_time_untreated
        Relative time on the untreated rows; ``-inf`` for never-treated.
    cluster_untreated
        Cluster identifier on the untreated rows.
    n_unit_columns
        Number of unit fixed-effect columns in ``design_untreated``.
        Used only for the degrees-of-freedom adjustment, which follows the
        absorbed-fixed-effect convention Stata's ``did_imputation`` uses:
        unit effects are absorbed and do not consume degrees of freedom,
        every other non-intercept column does.
    leads
        Negative relative times to estimate, e.g. ``[-3, -2, -1]``.
    alpha
        Two-sided level for the reported confidence intervals.

    Returns
    -------
    (frame, joint_test)
        ``frame`` has one row per lead with ``relative_time``, ``att``,
        ``se``, ``ci_lower``, ``ci_upper``, ``pvalue`` and ``n_obs``.
        ``joint_test`` carries the Wald statistic for the null that every
        lead coefficient is zero, computed from the full cluster-robust
        covariance rather than the diagonal.

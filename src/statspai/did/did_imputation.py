"""
Borusyak, Jaravel & Spiess (2024) imputation estimator for staggered DID.

The imputation approach estimates unit and time fixed effects using only
untreated observations, imputes counterfactual outcomes for treated
observations, and computes treatment effects as the difference between
observed and imputed outcomes. This avoids the negative-weighting problem
of TWFE regressions under heterogeneous treatment effects.

    Borusyak, Jaravel & Spiess (2024) imputation DID estimator.

    Estimates ATT by imputing counterfactual outcomes for treated
    observations using a TWFE model fit only on untreated data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : pd.DataFrame
        Panel data in long format.
    y : str
        Outcome variable name.
    group : str
        Unit identifier column.
    time : str
        Time period column.
    first_treat : str
        Column indicating the period of first treatment.
        Use ``np.inf``, ``np.nan``, or ``0`` for never-treated units.
    controls : list of str, optional
        Continuous time-varying controls, entering the Y(0) model
        additively. Stata ``did_imputation``'s ``controls()``.
    unit_covariates : list of str, optional
        Controls interacted with the **unit** fixed effects, i.e. one
        slope per unit. Stata's ``unitcontrols()``. The canonical use is
        ``unit_covariates=[time_col]``, which makes Y(0) carry
        unit-specific linear trends.

        Identification bites hard here: a unit-specific slope needs at
        least two untreated periods for that unit, so early-treated
        cohorts can lose their imputation entirely.
    time_covariates : list of str, optional
        Controls interacted with the **period** fixed effects, i.e. one
        coefficient per period. Stata's ``timecontrols()``. Typically a
        time-invariant unit characteristic whose effect is allowed to
        move over calendar time.
    fe : sequence of str, optional
        Which fixed effects the Y(0) model carries, replacing the default
        two-way ``unit + time``. Mirrors Stata ``did_imputation``'s
        ``fe()``. Each entry is one fixed effect, written either as a bare
        column or Stata-style with ``#`` for the interacted cell::

            fe=['time']                  # period FE only
            fe=['unit', 'state#year']    # unit FE + state-by-year FE
            fe=[]                        # no fixed effects at all

        Levels are factorized over the whole panel, so a cell seen only
        among treated rows still gets a column and is imputed rather than
        silently absorbing the reference level.
    horizon : list of int, optional
        Relative time periods for event study estimates,
        e.g. ``list(range(-5, 6))``. If ``None``, reports only the
        overall ATT (no event study disaggregation).
    cluster : str, optional
        Variable for cluster-robust standard errors.
        Defaults to ``group`` (unit-level clustering).
    alpha : float, default 0.05
        Significance level for confidence intervals.
    se_method : str, optional
        Shared DiD spelling for ``vce=`` — ``'analytic'``,
        ``'bootstrap'`` (also ``'cluster'``, ``'pairs'``) or ``'auto'``.
        Passing both raises. ``'auto'`` picks the cluster bootstrap when
        the design has at most 30 clusters (Cameron, Gelbach & Miller
        2008) and the analytic BJS variance otherwise: with few clusters
        the cluster-score sum behind any sandwich is itself noisy, which
        is a small-cluster problem rather than a defect in the formula.
    vce : {'analytic', 'bootstrap'}, default 'analytic'
        Standard-error mode for the overall ATT. ``'analytic'`` is the
        exact Borusyak--Jaravel--Spiess variance: the estimator is linear
        in the outcome, so its weights are computed rather than
        approximated, and the result reproduces Stata ``did_imputation``
        and R ``didimputation`` to ~5e-8. Before v1.23.0 this path used an
        approximation that was materially anti-conservative (18-36% too
        small on the harness fixtures); see MIGRATION.md.

        Measured, not asserted. On a homogeneous-effect design with a
        never-treated half, 400-800 replications per cell:

        ===========  ==========  ====================
        clusters     coverage    mean SE / sd(est)
        ===========  ==========  ====================
        30           0.925       0.985
        60           0.938       0.936
        120          0.948       0.978
        240          0.935       1.007
        480          **0.950**   0.983
        ===========  ==========  ====================

        Two things to read off it. The ratio sits at 1 throughout, so the
        variance formula carries no systematic bias — the approximation it
        replaced ran 18-36% low. And coverage reaches nominal by 480
        clusters, so the shortfall at 60 is a small-cluster effect rather
        than a missing term: there the standard error is simply *noisy*
        (dispersion 9.2% against 3.2% at 480), which fattens the
        studentised distribution (sd(t) = 1.04 against 1.007).

        A ``t(G-1)`` critical value barely helps (0.938 to 0.941 at
        G = 60) because the problem is the variability of the standard
        error, not the degrees of freedom. ``vce='bootstrap'`` is the
        remedy in small designs, and ``se_method='auto'`` selects it
        below 30 clusters.
        ``'bootstrap'`` resamples whole clusters and re-runs
        the full imputation estimator. Point estimates are identical either
        way; per-horizon event-study SEs are unaffected.
    n_boot : int, default 199
        Number of cluster-bootstrap replications when ``vce='bootstrap'``.
    boot_seed : int, default 0
        Seed for the cluster bootstrap (deterministic results).
    pretrends : int, optional
        Stata ``did_imputation, pretrends(k)``: estimate the ``k``
        pre-treatment placebo coefficients (horizons ``-k .. -1``, added
        to ``horizon`` if not already requested) and report their joint
        Wald test in ``model_info['pretrend_test']``.  Under the default
        ``pretrend_method='bjs'`` the test uses the full cluster-robust
        covariance of the auxiliary lead regression; under the other
        conventions it assumes the lead estimates are uncorrelated (valid
        but conservative), and :func:`statspai.bjs_pretrend_joint` gives
        the covariance-aware cluster-bootstrap version.
    pretrend_method : {'bjs', 'in-sample', 'symmetric'}, default 'bjs'
        How the **pre-treatment** event-study coefficients are built.  The
        post-treatment coefficients are imputation residuals either way;
        only the leads differ, and the difference is visible in the plot
        rather than in the ATT.

        - ``'bjs'`` — the convention of Stata ``did_imputation,
          pretrends(k)``: an auxiliary dynamic TWFE regression on the
          untreated observations, with all relative times earlier than the
          requested leads pooled into the omitted category.  Reproduces
          Stata's coefficients and standard errors.  Not available with
          ``fe=``, ``unit_covariates=`` or ``time_covariates=``.
        - ``'in-sample'`` — average the imputation residuals at
          pre-treatment relative times, as ``fect`` and ``did2s`` do.
          These are in-sample prediction errors: in a non-staggered design
          they equal the symmetric benchmark times the untreated unit
          share ``N0/N``, so they understate pre-trends, severely when
          most units are treated.  This was StatsPAI's behaviour before
          v1.23.0.
        - ``'symmetric'`` — Roth's (2026) repair, which uses the average
          of the pre-treatment periods as the reference for both halves of
          the path, so the plot matches a dynamic TWFE event study up to a
          common vertical shift and the usual visual heuristics apply.
          Non-staggered balanced designs without covariates only; raises
          otherwise rather than applying an unverified factor.

        The chosen convention and its caveat are recorded in
        ``model_info['pretrend_method']`` and
        ``model_info['event_study_convention']``.
    balanced : bool, default False
        Stata ``did_imputation, hbalance``: keep only eventually-treated
        units observed at *every* requested horizon, so the event-study
        composition is stable across ``k`` (no cohort churn).
        Never-treated units are always kept.  Requires ``horizon`` (or
        ``pretrends``).  Warns with the number of units dropped.
    min_n : int, optional
        Stata ``did_imputation, minn(#)``: drop event-study horizons
        with fewer than ``min_n`` treated observations (they are noisy
        and dominated by a single cohort).  Dropped horizons are listed
        in a warning and excluded from the pre-trend test.
    hetby : str, optional
        Stata ``did_imputation, hetby(varname)``: report heterogeneous
        overall ATTs by the levels of a **time-invariant** unit-level
        variable.  Results land in ``model_info['hetby']`` (one row per
        level: att, se, ci, pvalue, n_obs).  SEs use the same
        influence-function machinery as the overall ATT.
    weights : str, optional
        Column of estimation weights ``omega_i`` (Stata ``[aw=]``, R
        ``didimputation(weights=)``). The untreated Y(0) model is fit by
        weighted least squares, every reported average is the
        ``omega``-weighted mean over the treated cells it covers, and the
        exact variance uses the weighted projection. Like ``weights=`` on
        the other staggered estimators this changes the *estimand*: the
        weighted ATT averages over the population the treated units
        represent, not over the units. Not combinable with ``project=``.
    save_weights : bool, default False
        Stata ``did_imputation, saveweights()``: store the exact
        estimation weights ``w`` such that ``ATT = w'y`` in
        ``model_info['estimation_weights']`` (aligned with the rows of
        ``data``).  Treated rows get ``1/N1``; untreated rows get the
        (negative) imputation weights implied by the FE projection —
        useful for diagnosing which comparisons drive the estimate.
    save_residuals : bool, default False
        Stata ``did_imputation, saveresid()``: store the untreated-fit
        residuals ``y - ŷ⁰`` in ``model_info['residuals']`` (aligned
        with the rows of ``data``; ``NaN`` on treated rows, whose
        ``y - ŷ⁰`` is the treatment effect, not a residual).

    Returns
    -------
    CausalResult
        Result object with ``.summary()``, ``.plot()`` (event study),
        and ``.cite()`` methods. Event study coefficients are stored
        in ``model_info['event_study']``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import statspai as sp
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import pandas as pd
    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng(0)
    >>> rows = []
    >>> for unit in range(40):
    ...     first = [4, 7, 0][unit % 3]  # cohorts 4, 7, never-treated (0)
    ...     for year in range(1, 9):
    ...         treated = first != 0 and year >= first
    ...         te = 2.0 * (year - first + 1) if treated else 0.0
    ...         rows.append({'county': unit, 'year': year,
    ...                      'wage': unit * 0.1 + year + te + rng.normal(),
    ...                      'first_treat': first})
    >>> df = pd.DataFrame(rows)
    >>> result = sp.did_imputation(
    ...     data=df, y='wage', group='county', time='year',
    ...     first_treat='first_treat', horizon=list(range(-5, 6)),
    ... )
    >>> bool(result.estimate > 0)
    True
    >>> fig, ax = result.event_study_plot()

    Notes
    -----
    The algorithm proceeds in four steps:

    1. **Classify** observations as treated (t >= first_treat_i) or
       untreated (t < first_treat_i, or never-treated unit).
    2. **Estimate TWFE** on untreated observations only:
       Y_it = alpha_i + lambda_t + X_it'beta + eps_it.
    3. **Impute** counterfactual outcomes for treated observations:
       tau_hat_it = Y_it - (alpha_hat_i + lambda_hat_t + X_it'beta_hat).
    4. **Aggregate** into ATT or event-study ATT(k) and compute
       cluster-robust standard errors with a two-step adjustment.

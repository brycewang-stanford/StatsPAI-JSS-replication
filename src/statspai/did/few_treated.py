"""Inference for difference-in-differences with few treated groups.

The cluster-robust variance of a DiD coefficient is an average over clusters
of the *treated* side's variance as much as the control side's, so with one
or a handful of treated groups it is estimated from one or a handful of
draws and over-rejects badly -- 30 to 50 percent at a nominal 5 percent in
the designs of Conley and Taber (2011) [@conley2011inference] and Ferman and
Pinto (2019) [@ferman2019inference], whatever the total number of clusters.
The multiplier bootstrap and the wild cluster bootstrap inherit the problem;
the cluster jackknife (:func:`statspai.did.cs_jackknife`) mitigates it only
when the treated side itself has several clusters.

Both methods here take the opposite route: they estimate the sampling
distribution of the treatment coefficient from the *control* groups, which
are many, and read the treated groups' contribution off it.

Conley--Taber
    Residualise the outcome and the treatment on group and period fixed
    effects (and covariates), so that ``alphahat = sum_jt dtilde_jt
    ytilde_jt / sum_jt dtilde_jt^2``. Impose the null, and apply the
    *treated* groups' residualised treatment path to each control group's
    residual path. The resulting scalars are draws from the distribution of
    ``alphahat - alpha`` under the null; the test inverts them, and the
    confidence interval is ``alphahat`` minus their quantiles. Arbitrary
    serial correlation within a group is allowed -- the path enters as one
    linear combination -- at the price of assuming the group-level errors
    are identically distributed across groups.

Ferman--Pinto
    Relaxes that last assumption in the direction that matters in practice.
    When groups are aggregates of individuals, a group's error variance
    falls with its size, so control groups that are larger than the treated
    one produce too narrow a placebo distribution (and vice versa). They
    model ``Var(W_j) = A + B / M_j`` with ``M_j`` the group's number of
    underlying observations, estimate ``A`` and ``B`` by regressing the
    squared control-group statistics on ``1 / M_j``, and rescale every
    control draw to the treated group's variance before inverting.

Neither method estimates the treatment effect: the point estimate is the
usual two-way fixed-effects coefficient, which is *not* consistent with a
fixed number of treated groups. What they deliver is a test and an interval
for it.

    .. versionadded:: 1.30.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : pandas.DataFrame
        Group-by-period panel (one row per ``unit`` x ``time``). Individual
        level data must be collapsed to group means first; pass the cell
        counts as ``group_size`` so ``method='ferman_pinto'`` can use them.
    y : str
        Outcome column.
    id : str
        Group identifier (the level treatment switches at, e.g. the state).
        ``unit=`` and ``group=`` are accepted aliases.
    time : str
        Period column.
    treat : str
        Treatment indicator, 0/1 by group and period. Groups whose indicator
        is ever 1 are the treated groups; the rest are controls.
    method : {'conley_taber', 'ferman_pinto'}, default 'conley_taber'
        ``'ferman_pinto'`` additionally rescales the control-group draws for
        the heteroskedasticity implied by unequal group sizes; it requires
        ``group_size``.
    covariates : list of str, optional
        Partialled out together with the fixed effects (alias ``controls=``).
    group_size : str, optional
        Number of underlying observations behind each group-period cell
        (``M_j``). Required by ``method='ferman_pinto'``; a group's value is
        averaged over its periods.
    alpha : float, default 0.05
        One minus the confidence level.
    null_value : float, default 0.0
        The null the reported ``pvalue`` tests.
    max_draws : int, default 10000
        With more than one treated group the placebo distribution is built
        from combinations of that many control groups; all of them are used
        when there are at most ``max_draws``, otherwise that many random
        combinations are drawn.
    seed : int or None, default 0
        Seed for the random combinations.

    Returns
    -------
    CausalResult
        ``estimate`` is the two-way fixed-effects coefficient (unchanged by
        the method), ``se`` is the standard deviation of the placebo
        distribution -- reported for scale only, since the interval is not
        ``estimate +/- z * se`` -- ``ci`` is the inverted interval
        ``estimate - quantiles``, and ``pvalue`` tests ``null_value``.
        ``detail`` holds one row per placebo draw; ``model_info`` records
        the treated groups, the counts, and, for Ferman--Pinto, the fitted
        variance function.

    Notes
    -----
    The interval is not symmetric around the estimate: it inverts an
    empirical distribution, which is exactly the point when that
    distribution is skewed. ``pvalue`` is the two-sided placebo p-value,
    ``(1 + #{|W| >= |alphahat - null|}) / (1 + n_draws)``.

    Both methods require many control groups, since the placebo distribution
    is estimated from them; fewer than ten raises.

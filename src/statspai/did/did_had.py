"""Heterogeneous-adoption DiD with quasi-untreateded groups (did_had).

de Chaisemartin, Ciccia, D'Haultfœuille & Knau, "Difference-in-Differences
Estimators When No Unit Remains Untreated" (arXiv:2405.04465).

The design
----------
Every group is untreated in period 1, and every treated group adopts at
the **same** period F, with heterogeneous dose. Timing does not vary — if
it does, this is the wrong estimator and ``sp.did_multiplegt_dyn`` is the
right one.

The problem is that **no group stays untreateded**, so there is no control
group to supply the counterfactual outcome evolution. What the design
does offer, when doses are concentrated near zero, is *quasi-untreateded*
groups: groups whose dose is small enough to be treated as effectively
zero. The counterfactual is then the intercept of a local polynomial
regression of the outcome evolution on the dose, evaluated at dose 0.

That makes the estimand a DiD/RD hybrid: a difference in outcome
evolutions, where one arm is an RD-style boundary extrapolation rather
than an observed group.

The estimator, per event-study horizon ℓ
----------------------------------------
    ΔY_ℓ = Y_{F-1+ℓ} − Y_{F-1}                    outcome evolution
    D_ℓ  = dose at F-1+ℓ  (or cumulative, see ``dynamic``)

    μ̂    = local polynomial fit of ΔY_ℓ on D_ℓ at D = 0
    β̂_ℓ  = (E[ΔY_ℓ] − μ̂) / E[D_ℓ]

The average evolution, minus what a dose-zero group would have done,
rescaled by the average dose. Standard errors and the bias correction
come from the same fit — see :func:`statspai.lprobust_at_point`.

.. warning::
   The reported interval is **not symmetric** around the point estimate.
   ``did_had`` reports the *conventional* estimate with a
   *bias-corrected* interval, centred at ``β̂ − B̂`` where
   ``B̂ = −(τ_us − τ_bc)/E[D]``. Reading the interval as
   ``estimate ± z·se`` will not reproduce it, and that is deliberate:
   the point estimate is the interpretable quantity, the interval is the
   one with correct coverage.

Quasi-untreated groups have to exist
------------------------------------
Everything above is meaningless if no group has a dose near zero, so the
paper's §3.3 test is reported alongside every effect. It compares the
smallest positive dose to the gap between the smallest and second
smallest; both statistics converge to a ratio of iid Exponential(1)
variables, giving ``p = 1/(1 + T)``. It needs no bandwidth and is
computed here in closed form.

An identical T and p across every horizon indicates the treatment
changes only once.

def quasi_untreated_test(dose: Sequence[float]) -> Dict[str, float]:
    """Test that quasi-untreateded groups exist (dCDH et al., §3.3).

    The whole design rests on some group having a dose close enough to
    zero to stand in for an untreated one. This checks it, in closed
    form, with no bandwidth involved::

        T = D(1) / (D(2) − D(1))        smallest positive dose over the
                                        gap to the second smallest
        p = 1 / (1 + T)

    ``T`` converges to a ratio of two iid Exponential(1) variables, whose
    CDF is ``t/(1+t)`` — hence the p-value. A **large** T means the
    smallest dose is far from zero relative to the spacing, i.e. no
    credible quasi-untreateded group, and drives p toward 0.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dose : sequence of float
        Doses at the horizon being tested. Non-positive values are
        dropped: an exact zero is a genuine stayer, not a quasi-stayer,
        and the statistic is about how close the *positive* doses get.

    Returns
    -------
    dict with ``statistic``, ``pvalue``, ``d_min``, ``d_second``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : DataFrame
        Long panel, one row per group-period.
    y, group, time, treat : str
        Column names. ``treat`` is the dose, not an indicator.
    effects : int, default 1
        Number of event-study effects. Effect ℓ is the effect at period
        ``F-1+ℓ``, i.e. ℓ periods after adoption.
    placebo : int, default 0
        Number of placebo estimates, built symmetrically: the ``F-1`` to
        ``F-1+ℓ`` evolution is replaced by ``F-1`` to ``F-1-ℓ``, with the
        dose taken from the matching post period.
    bandwidth : float or sequence of float, optional
        Bandwidth for the local polynomial fit at dose zero — one value,
        or one per reported horizon (placebos first, then effects).

        **Required for now.** Stata's default ``bw_method('mse-dpi')``
        selector is not yet implemented; see Notes.
    kernel : {'epanechnikov', 'triangular', 'uniform', 'gaussian'}
        Default epanechnikov, matching ``did_had``.
    alpha : float, default 0.05
        1 − α confidence level.
    dynamic : bool, default False
        Scale effect ℓ by the average **cumulative** dose from F to
        ``F-1+ℓ`` instead of the dose at ``F-1+ℓ``. The current-dose
        normalization is right under a static model, the cumulative one
        under a dynamic model where past treatment still matters.
    yatchew : bool, default False
        Report the Yatchew differencing test alongside each horizon.
        Effects are tested for **linearity** in the dose (order 1),
        placebos for **mean independence** of the pre-period evolution
        from the future dose (order 0).

        Theorem 5 of the paper: with (quasi-)untreated groups, plain OLS
        of the evolution on the dose is unbiased for the same estimand
        *iff* that conditional expectation is linear. Failing to reject
        therefore licenses the far simpler estimator; rejecting says the
        nonparametric machinery is doing real work.
    trends_lin : bool, default False
        Allow group-specific linear trends, estimated from each group's
        ``F-2`` to ``F-1`` evolution and subtracted. Costs one placebo,
        and needs at least three pre-treat periods.

    Returns
    -------
    CausalResult
        ``.detail`` has one row per horizon with ``estimate``, ``se``,
        ``ci_lower``, ``ci_upper``, ``bandwidth``, ``n_in_bw`` and the
        quasi-untreateded test. ``.estimate`` is effect 1.

    Notes
    -----
    **The interval is not symmetric around the estimate.** It is centred
    at ``estimate − bias``; see the module docstring.

    **Bandwidth selection is not implemented.** ``did_had`` defaults to
    ``mse-dpi``, whose implementation lives in a compiled Mata library
    (``nprobust``'s ``nprobust_lp_mse_dpi``) with no readable source, so
    reproducing it means re-deriving the selector from Calonico,
    Cattaneo & Farrell (2019) rather than porting it. Until that is done
    and pinned, ``bandwidth`` must be supplied explicitly — an estimator
    that silently used a *different* bandwidth from the reference would
    produce numbers that look right and are not.

    """Yatchew differencing test that E[y | x] is a polynomial of ``order``.

    Why ``did_had`` reports it: Theorem 5 of de Chaisemartin et al. says
    that in a design with (quasi-)untreated groups, the plain OLS
    coefficient from regressing the outcome evolution on the dose is
    unbiased for the same estimand **if and only if** that conditional
    expectation is linear. So a non-rejection licenses the far simpler
    OLS estimator, and a rejection says the nonparametric machinery is
    doing real work rather than decorating an OLS number.

    The test compares two variance estimates of the same residual
    variance:

    * ``s2_lin`` — residual variance from the order-``order`` polynomial
      fit, consistent **only if** that model is right;
    * ``s2_diff`` — ``0.5 * mean((y_i − y_{i−1})²)`` over the x-sorted
      data, consistent whatever the shape.

    Under the null they agree; under the alternative the parametric one
    is inflated. The test is therefore one-sided.

    ``order=0`` tests mean-independence rather than linearity, which is
    what the *placebo* horizons need: there the null is that the
    pre-period evolution does not depend on the future dose.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : sequence of float
        Running variable and outcome, same length.
    order : int, default 1
        Polynomial order under the null. 1 = linear, 0 = constant.
    het_robust : bool, default True
        Use the heteroskedasticity-robust statistic of the paper's
        Appendix E. ``did_had`` always does.

    Returns
    -------
    dict with ``s2_lin``, ``s2_diff``, ``statistic``, ``pvalue``, ``n``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np, statspai as sp
    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng(0)
    >>> x = rng.uniform(0, 1, 400)
    >>> lin = sp.yatchew_linearity_test(x, 2 * x + rng.normal(0, .1, 400))
    >>> bool(lin['pvalue'] > 0.05)      # truly linear: not rejected
    True

"""
Sun & Abraham (2021) interaction-weighted event-study estimator.

Fits a *saturated* regression that interacts every cohort dummy with
every relative-time dummy, then aggregates the interaction coefficients
across cohorts using empirical cohort shares to deliver the IW
estimator δ̂^IW_ℓ that is robust to heterogeneous treatment effects
(Sun & Abraham 2021, Theorem 1 / Corollary 1).

Standard errors are computed from the classical OLS sandwich:

    Var(β̂) = (X'X)⁻¹  ( Σ_c  X_c' u_c u_c' X_c )  (X'X)⁻¹

clustered at the unit (or a user-supplied) level.  δ̂^IW_ℓ is a product
of two estimated objects — the interaction coefficients and the cohort
shares — so its variance carries two terms (SA 2021, Prop. 3):

    Var(δ̂^IW_ℓ) = w_ℓ' Var(β̂) w_ℓ  +  β_ℓ' Var(ŵ_ℓ) β_ℓ

The second term is the cost of estimating the shares. It is degenerate
whenever a single cohort is eligible at ℓ (then ŵ ≡ 1), which is why
omitting it is easy to miss: on ``mpdta`` it changes nothing at
single-cohort event times and understates the SE by up to 2% where two
cohorts contribute.

.. warning::
   The two reference implementations disagree here and StatsPAI cannot
   match both. Stata ``eventstudyinteract`` (Liyang Sun's own package)
   carries the share term; R ``fixest::sunab`` treats the shares as
   fixed and reports the first term only. StatsPAI follows
   ``eventstudyinteract``, since Prop. 3 derives the share term and
   dropping it is anti-conservative. Expect StatsPAI SEs to sit slightly
   *above* ``fixest``'s at multi-cohort event times and to agree with it
   exactly at single-cohort ones.

    *mutually exclusive indicators*, the design matrix is orthogonal with

    which is what is computed here — same estimator, no SUR machinery.
    Derivation: the coefficient at ℓ is the within-ℓ mean of the cohort
    indicator, so its residual is ``1{g_i = g} − ŵ_{g,ℓ}``; the robust
    meat at ℓ is then ``Σ_i u_ig u_ih / N_ℓ²``, which equals
    ``ŵ_g(1 − ŵ_g)/N_ℓ`` on the diagonal and ``−ŵ_g ŵ_h / N_ℓ`` off it.

    ``n_obs`` counts *observations* at the relative time, not units,
    matching eventstudyinteract's panel-level normalization.

    Returns a zero matrix when the shares are degenerate (a single

    Sun & Abraham's estimator produced no pre-trend test at all before
    this: callers had to read the event-study table by eye, which invites
    the classic error of declaring parallel trends because no single
    pre-period coefficient reached significance. Individually
    insignificant leads are routinely jointly significant.

    The test is a Wald statistic on the pre-period IW estimates using
    their **joint** covariance, not the diagonal:

    relative-time dummies are mutually exclusive, so the share estimates
    at different ℓ are built from disjoint observations and their
    covariance block is zero off-diagonal (same algebra as
    :func:`_cohort_share_vcov`).

    ``pretest_periods=k`` keeps the ``k`` **estimated** leads closest to

    Sun & Abraham (2021) interaction-weighted event-study estimator.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : pd.DataFrame
        Long-format panel data.
    y : str
        Outcome variable.
    g : str
        Cohort variable: first treatment period (0 or inf = never treated).
    t : str
        Time period variable.
    i : str
        Unit identifier.
    event_window : tuple of (int, int), optional
        (min_relative_time, max_relative_time).
        Default: observed range in the data.
    control_group : str, default 'nevertreated'
        ``'nevertreated'`` or ``'lastcohort'``.  When ``'lastcohort'``,
        the latest treated cohort is used as the reference and dropped
        from the IW aggregation. Ignored when ``control_cohort`` is given.
    control_cohort : str, scalar or sequence, optional
        Nominate the reference cohort explicitly instead of inferring it,
        mirroring Stata ``eventstudyinteract``'s ``control_cohort(varname)``.
        Accepts either

        - a **column name** holding a 0/1 indicator of control units (the
          Stata spelling), or
        - a **cohort value** — or list of values — drawn from ``g``.

        Whatever it selects becomes the reference group and is removed from
        the set of estimated cohorts, so no unit sits on both sides of its
        own comparison. Useful when the never-treated group is unsuitable
        (contaminated, or absent) and a specific late cohort is the
        credible control.

        .. note::
           Sun & Abraham (2021) require the control cohort to be untreated
           over the estimation window. When using a last-treated cohort,
           drop the periods in which it turns on — StatsPAI will not do
           that for you, exactly as ``eventstudyinteract`` will not.
    covariates : list of str, optional
        Additional controls (time-varying; added linearly).
    cluster : str, optional
        Cluster variable for SEs. Default: clusters on ``i``.
    aggregation : {'event_time', 'fixest_att'}, default 'event_time'
        Overall post-treatment summary convention. ``'event_time'`` is the
        historical StatsPAI default: equal-weight the post-treatment
        relative-time IW effects. ``'fixest_att'`` weights each post
        cohort-time cell by its treated cohort size, matching
        ``fixest::summary(..., agg='att')`` and Stata/R default ATT
        parity on balanced staggered panels.
    share_variance : bool, default True
        Whether Var(δ̂_ℓ) carries the cohort-share estimation term
        ``β' Var(ŵ) β`` of Sun & Abraham (2021, Prop. 3). ``True`` is the
        authors' own Stata ``eventstudyinteract`` convention and is what
        the Stata parity module pins at machine precision. ``False``
        treats the interaction weights as fixed, which is what
        ``fixest::sunab`` does; the two coincide wherever a single cohort
        is eligible at a relative time and differ by the (positive
        semi-definite) share term wherever several are. Point estimates
        do not depend on this switch.

        Degrees of freedom follow the ``fixest`` / ``reghdfe`` "nested"
        rule on both settings: the small-sample factor is
        ``(N-1)/(N-K) * G/(G-1)`` with ``K`` counting the estimated
        cohort-by-relative-time cells, the covariates, and the levels of
        every fixed effect that is *not* nested in the cluster variable
        (with the default ``cluster=i`` that is the time effects only).
    alpha : float, default 0.05
        Significance level.
    pretest : {'joint', 'none'}, default 'joint'
        Report a joint Wald test that all pre-treatment IW effects are
        zero, in ``model_info['pretrend_test']``.

        Reading the event-study table by eye is the standard way to get
        this wrong: leads that are individually insignificant are often
        jointly significant, and "no star on any lead" is not evidence of
        parallel trends. The test uses the full covariance across leads,
        not the diagonal.

        Failing to reject is still weak evidence — it is a statement about
        power as much as about trends. Pair it with
        :func:`statspai.honest_did` or :func:`statspai.pretrends_power`.
    pretest_periods : int, optional
        Restrict the joint test to the ``pretest_periods`` **estimated**
        leads nearest treatment, in the spirit of Stata's ``pretrends(k)``.
        Default uses every estimated lead. Distant leads often rest on few
        cohorts and pull the statistic toward non-rejection.

        Counted over the leads that exist, not by literal event time:
        ℓ = −1 is the omitted reference, so on a panel whose leads are
        −4, −3, −2 the value ``2`` selects ``[-3, -2]``.

    Returns
    -------
    CausalResult
        ``.detail`` is the event-study table (IW ATT by relative time
        with cluster-robust SE and 1−α CI).  ``.estimate`` / ``.se``

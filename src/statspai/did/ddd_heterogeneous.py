"""Heterogeneity-robust triple differences (DDD) for staggered adoption.

Applies a Callaway-Sant'Anna-style group-time decomposition to the DDD
estimator so that staggered adoption with heterogeneous treatment
effects does not produce negative weights (the classical issue with
TWFE DDD, analogous to Goodman-Bacon 2021's concern for TWFE DID).

Identification outline (canonical 2x2x2 extended to staggered)
--------------------------------------------------------------
Let G ∈ {0, g_1, g_2, ...} index first-treatment cohort, T the period,
and B ∈ {0, 1} the within-treatment-group subgroup (B=1 affected,
B=0 placebo / unaffected). For each pair (g, t) with t ≥ g:

    DID_B(g, t)        = {E[Y_{it} | G=g,  B=1] − E[Y_{ig-1} | G=g,  B=1]}
                         − {E[Y_{it} | G=0, B=1] − E[Y_{ig-1} | G=0, B=1]}

    DID_placebo(g, t)  = {E[Y_{it} | G=g,  B=0] − E[Y_{ig-1} | G=g,  B=0]}
                         − {E[Y_{it} | G=0, B=0] − E[Y_{ig-1} | G=0, B=0]}

    DDD(g, t)          = DID_B(g, t) − DID_placebo(g, t)

Aggregated across (g, t) with CS-style simple weights (share of treated
units in cohort × post-treatment period), this yields the overall DDD
ATT estimate. Under the Olden-Møen (2022) interpretation, the placebo
arm DID_placebo(g, t) is the tested quantity — it should be zero under
the DDD parallel-trends relaxation.

.. note::
   **(citation needed.)** A CS-style decomposition for DDD is also associated
   with work by Strezhnev, but the exact title / venue / DOI could not be
   confirmed against Crossref, so no citation string is asserted here and
   nothing was added to ``paper.bib``. Per CLAUDE.md section 10 a missing
   citation is preferable to an unverified one.

Cross-language reference
------------------------
The per-(g, t) cells are pinned against ``triplediff::ddd`` (Ortiz-Villavicencio
& Sant'Anna 2025, `ortiz2025better`) with ``xformla = ~1``, ``est_method="dr"``,
``control_group="nevertreated"``: with no covariates the doubly-robust DDD
reduces to the unconditional cell means computed here, and the two agree to
machine precision. See ``tests/reference_parity/test_ddd_triplediff_parity.py``
and Track A module ``77_ddd``.

The **aggregation weights differ by convention** and are exposed as
``weight_by``; see that parameter's documentation. The cell estimates --
the substantive object -- are identical either way.

Scope & caveats
---------------
- Controls: ``control_group="nevertreated"`` (default) or
  ``"notyettreated"``; see that parameter for how the latter departs from
  ``triplediff`` 0.2.4.
- Covariates: ``x=`` with ``est_method`` in ``{"dr", "ipw", "reg"}`` gives
  the conditional-DDD estimators of Ortiz-Villavicencio and Sant'Anna
  (2025). Adding covariates linearly to a triple-interaction regression
  (what ``sp.ddd(covariates=...)`` does) is not equivalent in general.
- Inference: ``se="analytic"`` (influence functions, what ``triplediff``
  reports; the default with covariates) or ``se="bootstrap"`` (unit-level
  cluster bootstrap; the default without covariates and the only path that
  fills ``model_info['placebo_joint_test']``).

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : DataFrame
        Long-format panel.
    y : str
        Outcome column.
    unit : str
        Unit identifier (panel id).
    time : str
        Time period column (int-valued).
    cohort : str
        First-treatment period column. ``never_value`` (default 0)
        marks never-treated units.
    subgroup : str
        Binary column: 1 = affected subgroup (where effect is expected),
        0 = unaffected / placebo subgroup (where effect should be zero
        under DDD parallel trends).
    never_value : any, default 0
        Value in ``cohort`` that marks never-treated units.
    n_boot : int, default 500
        Cluster-bootstrap replications for SE.
    alpha : float, default 0.05
    seed : int, optional
    weight_by : {"eligible", "cohort"}, default "eligible"
        How the per-``(g, t)`` cells are weighted into the overall ATT.

        ``"eligible"`` weights cell ``(g, t)`` by the number of treated
        units in cohort ``g`` that are in the affected subgroup -- the
        units the reported effect is actually about.

        ``"cohort"`` weights by the size of cohort ``g`` counting *both*
        subgroups, which is what ``triplediff::ddd`` + ``agg_ddd(type=
        "simple")`` does (its ``pg`` is ``mean(first_treat == g)`` over
        all units). Pass this to reproduce that package's overall number.

        The two coincide when the affected share is the same in every
        cohort, and drift apart as it varies. Which one is wanted depends
        on the estimand: neither is a bug, and the per-cell estimates are
        identical either way. The default is left on ``"eligible"``
        because changing it would move the number existing callers get
        back; ``model_info["weight_by"]`` records which was used.
    x : list of str, optional
        Base-period covariates. Identification then rests on *conditional*
        DDD parallel trends: the three two-by-two comparisons behind the
        estimand each get a propensity score and an outcome regression,
        combined doubly robustly.
    est_method : {"dr", "ipw", "reg"}, default "dr"
        Doubly robust (consistent if either nuisance is right), inverse
        probability weighting (needs the propensity score), or outcome
        regression (needs the regression). With no covariates all three
        collapse to the same unconditional difference of means.
    control_group : {"nevertreated", "notyettreated"}, default "nevertreated"
        Which units serve as controls. ``"notyettreated"`` adds cohorts
        treated after the comparison period, run against the treated cohort
        one control cohort at a time and combined by minimum distance
        (inverse-covariance weights), which is the structure the reference
        implementation uses.

        .. warning::
           The not-yet-treated path does NOT reproduce ``triplediff`` 0.2.4's
           numbers, on purpose. Its per-control-cohort estimates agree with
           ours exactly, but it writes each cohort's influence function into
           the panel-length vector using a boolean index of the wrong length
           -- R prints "number of items to replace is not a multiple of
           replacement length" on every such call -- so the combined
           influence function picks up units that appear in no comparison,
           and that feeds the weights, the estimate and the standard error.
           Cells where the comparison happens to span the whole panel are
           unaffected and do agree. See
           ``tests/reference_parity/test_ddd_triplediff_parity.py``.
    se : {"analytic", "bootstrap"}, optional
        ``"analytic"`` uses the influence functions -- exact, fast, and what
        ``triplediff`` reports. ``"bootstrap"`` clusters on ``unit`` and is
        the only path that fills in ``model_info['placebo_joint_test']``,
        because that test needs the joint covariance of the placebo arms
        rather than of the DDD.

        Defaults to ``"bootstrap"`` without covariates (unchanged from
        earlier releases, and it keeps the placebo test) and to
        ``"analytic"`` with them, where there is no prior behaviour to
        preserve and the bootstrap would refit both nuisances inside every
        draw. ``model_info['se_method']`` records the resolved choice.

    Returns
    -------
    CausalResult
        ``estimate`` is the aggregate DDD ATT; ``detail`` carries per
        (g, t) decomposition; ``model_info['placebo_joint_test']`` is a
        joint Wald on the unaffected-subgroup DIDs.

    Examples
    --------
    Staggered-adoption panel: two treated cohorts (2012, 2014) plus a
    never-treated control arm. Only the affected subgroup (B=1) carries
    the planted DDD effect of 4.0.

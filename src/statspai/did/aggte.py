"""
Aggregated group-time ATTs for staggered DID with multiplier bootstrap.

Implements the four aggregation schemes of Callaway & Sant'Anna (2021):

- ``simple``   — cohort-size-weighted average over all post-treatment (g, t)
- ``dynamic``  — event-study: average ATT by relative time e = t − g
- ``group``    — average ATT per cohort g across its post-treatment periods
  (the reported overall weights those θ(g) by treated cohort size)
- ``calendar`` — average ATT per calendar time t across already-treated cohorts

Inference is by multiplier bootstrap applied to the influence functions
of the underlying ATT(g, t) estimates, with Rademacher (±1) weights —
matching what the R package ``did`` actually draws via
``BMisc::multiplier_bootstrap`` (its docs cite Mammen 1993, but the
implementation is Rademacher).  This reproduces the uniform
(simultaneous) confidence bands that are the signature of R ``did`` /
Stata ``csdid``.

    Aggregate group-time ATT(g, t) estimates from ``callaway_santanna``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : CausalResult
        Output of :func:`callaway_santanna`. Must contain influence
        functions in ``result._influence_funcs``.
    type : {'simple', 'dynamic', 'group', 'calendar'}, default 'simple'
        Aggregation scheme. ``'dynamic'`` is the event study.
    balance_e : int, optional
        Only used when ``type='dynamic'``. If given, the event study
        restricts attention to cohorts observed over the *balanced* set of
        event times ``{-∞ ≤ e ≤ balance_e}``. This is the ``balance_e``
        option of R's :func:`did::aggte`.
    min_e, max_e : float, default (-inf, inf)
        Truncate the reported event-time window.
    na_rm : bool, default True
        Drop ATT(g, t) with missing / infinite SE before aggregating.
    bstrap : bool, default True
        If ``True``, compute SE / CI by multiplier bootstrap (Rademacher
        weights, matching the R ``did`` implementation) on the influence
        functions — required for the uniform ``cband``. If ``False``, use
        the closed-form influence-function SE instead, which carries the
        same cross-cell covariances but gives pointwise intervals only.
    boot_type : {'multiplier'}, default 'multiplier'
        Only ``'multiplier'`` is supported; kept for ``csdid`` parity.
    n_boot : int, default 1000
        Number of bootstrap replications.
    cband : bool, default True
        If ``True`` and ``type != 'simple'``, report a *uniform* confidence
        band (sup-t critical value) across the aggregation dimension.
        Otherwise pointwise intervals.
    alpha : float, default 0.05
        Nominal level for confidence intervals.
    agg_weights : {'did', 'csdid'}, default 'did'
        Which implementation's aggregation weights to use. ``'did'`` gives
        a cohort one weight -- its share of the treated -- constant across
        ``t``, which is R ``did``'s rule and what this function has always
        done. ``'csdid'`` weights each *cell* by its own treated-observation
        count, which is Stata ``csdid``'s rule (``csdid_group`` in
        ``csdid_estat.ado``); its group average additionally enters each
        cohort at its *mean* cell weight, so a cohort observed for fewer
        post-treatment periods is not down-weighted for it. The two coincide
        on a balanced panel and differ on repeated cross-sections -- by 0.02
        to 1.4 percent on the fixture in
        ``tests/reference_parity/test_rcs_aggregation_conventions.py``.
        Available for ``type='simple'`` and ``type='group'``.

        .. versionadded:: 1.31.0
    share_variance : bool, default True
        Carry the sampling variability of the *estimated* cohort shares
        into the aggregated variance (R ``did:::wif``; the Callaway &
        Sant'Anna reference convention). ``False`` holds the cohort shares
        fixed, which is the convention of Stata ``csdid``'s
        ``estat group`` aggregate (``GAverage``); point estimates are
        identical either way and only the ``'group'`` overall (and any
        multi-cohort cell) standard error changes. Use ``False`` to
        reproduce ``csdid`` digit for digit.

        .. versionadded:: 1.29.0
    random_state : int, optional
        Seed for the multiplier bootstrap.

    Returns
    -------
    CausalResult
        ``.estimate`` / ``.se`` hold the overall aggregated ATT,
        matching R's ``did::aggte`` print convention:

        - ``'simple'``   — the single cohort-share-weighted overall ATT
        - ``'dynamic'``  — simple average of *post-treatment* event times
          (e ≥ 0); pre-treatment cells are placebos and excluded
        - ``'group'``    — treated-cohort-size weighted average of the
          per-cohort θ(g) estimates
        - ``'calendar'`` — simple average of the per-calendar-time θ(t)
          estimates

        ``.detail`` is a tidy frame with one row per aggregation cell and
        both pointwise and (if requested) uniform bands.

"""
Causal Mediation Analysis module for StatsPAI.

Implements modern causal mediation analysis following Imai, Keele, and
Tingley (2010), decomposing total treatment effects into:
- Average Causal Mediation Effect (ACME): indirect effect through mediator
- Average Direct Effect (ADE): direct effect not through mediator

Also supports the classical Baron-Kenny approach for comparison.

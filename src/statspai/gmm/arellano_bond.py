Arellano-Bond (1991) and Blundell-Bond (1998) dynamic panel GMM.

Estimates dynamic panel models of the form:

    Y_{it} = ρ Y_{i,t-1} + X_{it}'β + α_i + ε_{it}

using GMM with lagged levels (Arellano-Bond) or lagged levels and
differences (Blundell-Bond system GMM) as instruments.

The Arellano-Bond first-differenced estimator removes the fixed effect
α_i by first-differencing and then exploits the **block-diagonal**
GMM moment conditions E[Y_{i,s} ΔU_{it}] = 0 for s ≤ t-2: every lagged
level that is available for period t is a separate instrument for that
period's differenced equation. The one-step weight matrix is
(Σ_i Z_i' H Z_i)⁻¹ where H encodes the MA(1) structure of the
first-differenced i.i.d. errors (2 on the diagonal, -1 on the first
off-diagonals). This matches Stata's ``xtabond`` and ``xtdpd``.

All standard errors, the Sargan/Hansen over-identification tests, and the
Arellano-Bond AR(1)/AR(2) serial-correlation tests are validated to
machine precision against Stata 18 ``xtabond ..., noconstant`` (one-step
robust and non-robust, two-step conventional, and two-step
Windmeijer-corrected) on the canonical ``abdata`` employment panel — see
``tests/reference_parity/test_dynpanel_abdata_parity.py``.

The numerics live in :mod:`statspai.gmm._dynpanel`; this module is the
documented user-facing surface.

    Equivalent to Stata's ``xtabond`` / ``xtabond2``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : pd.DataFrame
        Balanced or unbalanced panel in long format.
    y : str
        Dependent variable.
    x : list of str, optional
        Strictly exogenous regressors. Entered in first differences both
        as regressors and as their own (standard) instruments. Accepts
        Stata lag-operator syntax — ``"w"``, ``"L.w"``, ``"L2.k"``,
        ``"L(0/2).k"`` — so the canonical Arellano-Bond (1991) employment
        equation is a single call:
        ``x=["l(0/1).w", "l(0/2).k"], lags=2``.
    id : str, default 'id'
        Unit identifier.
    time : str, default 'time'
        Time period variable. Treated as an **ordinal** sequence: the
        sorted distinct values define consecutive periods, so a missing
        period (gap) is recognised, but non-integer / irregularly-spaced
        codes are collapsed to their rank order.
    lags : int, default 1
        Number of lags of Y to include (ρ₁ Y_{t-1} + ... + ρ_p Y_{t-p}).
    gmm_lags : tuple (min, max), default (2, None)
        Range of lags of Y (in levels) used as GMM instruments. ``min``
        must be ≥ 2 (deeper lags are orthogonal to the differenced error).
        ``max=None`` uses **all** available deeper lags, matching Stata's
        ``xtabond`` default. Setting ``max`` caps the instrument count
        (Stata's ``maxldep()``).
    method : str, default 'difference'
        ``'difference'`` — Arellano-Bond first-differenced GMM; parity with
        Stata's ``xtabond ..., noconstant``.

        ``'system'`` — Blundell-Bond (1998) system GMM: the level equation
        is stacked alongside the transformed one and instrumented with
        lagged *differences* (E[Δy_{i,t-1}(α_i + ε_{it})] = 0), and an
        intercept becomes identified. Prefer it when the series is
        persistent: as ρ approaches 1 the lagged levels become weak
        instruments for the differences and difference GMM is badly biased
        (on ``abdata`` it returns ρ̂ = 1.02; system GMM returns 0.69).
        Parity with ``xtabond2 ... robust`` — one-step, two-step
        Windmeijer, and collapsed — to machine precision.

        The extra level moments are an *additional* assumption (the
        deviations of the initial conditions from the long-run mean must be
        uncorrelated with α_i). Report the difference-in-Hansen test for
        the level instruments before relying on them.

        ``'ah'`` — Anderson-Hsiao (1981) simple IV: **one** pooled
        instrument for the differenced lagged dependent variable instead of
        the block-diagonal set, chosen by ``ah_instrument``. Consistent but
        inefficient, and the natural robustness check on an Arellano-Bond
        fit: it uses so few moments that instrument proliferation cannot be
        driving the answer, so a large gap between the two is informative
        about the instrument set rather than about the data.
    twostep : bool, default False
        Use two-step GMM with the efficient weight matrix. When
        ``robust=True`` the Windmeijer (2005) finite-sample correction is
        applied to the two-step standard errors; with ``robust=False`` the
        conventional (downward-biased) two-step SEs are returned and a
        warning is issued.
    robust : bool, default True
        Heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors (Windmeijer-corrected
        for two-step). When ``False``, the classical one/two-step VCE.
    alpha : float, default 0.05
        Significance level.
    predetermined : list of str, optional
        Regressors that are *predetermined* (weakly exogenous):
        E[x_{is} ε_{it}] = 0 for s ≤ t but not for s > t. Their own lags
        from ``predetermined_lags`` (default 1 and deeper) enter as
        block-diagonal GMM instruments rather than as a single Δx column.
        Accepts the same lag-operator syntax as ``x``. Equivalent to
        Stata's ``xtabond ..., pre()`` / ``xtabond2 ... gmm(x, lag(1 .))``.
    endogenous : list of str, optional
        Regressors correlated with the *contemporaneous* error. Their lags
        from ``endogenous_lags`` (default 2 and deeper) are used as GMM
        instruments. Equivalent to ``xtabond ..., endogenous()`` /
        ``xtabond2 ... gmm(x, lag(2 .))``.
    predetermined_lags, endogenous_lags : tuple (min, max), optional
        Instrument lag windows for the two classes above. ``None`` on
        either element means "class default" for the minimum and "all
        available deeper lags" for the maximum.

        Lags are **absolute**, i.e. counted from the equation period, which
        is ``xtabond2``'s ``gmm(x, lag(a b))`` convention and the one the
        modern literature states. Stata's older ``xtabond`` counts *further*
        lags beyond the deepest lag of the variable that appears as a
        regressor, so ``xtabond ..., pre(w, lagstruct(p, .))`` maps to
        ``predetermined=['l(0/p).w'], predetermined_lags=(p + 1, None)`` and
        ``endogenous(w, lagstruct(p, .))`` to
        ``endogenous_lags=(p + 2, None)``. Both mappings are pinned by
        reference-parity tests.
    collapse : bool, default False
        Collapse the block-diagonal instrument sets — one column per lag
        *distance* instead of one per (period, distance) pair. This is
        Roodman's (2009) remedy for instrument proliferation: the
        uncollapsed count grows as O(T²), which overfits the endogenous
        regressor, biases the estimate toward the within estimator, and
        pushes the Hansen p-value toward an uninformative 1.0. Matches
        ``xtabond2, collapse``.
    orthogonal : bool, default False
        Use Arellano-Bover (1995) forward orthogonal deviations instead of first
        differences for the transformed equation: subtract from each
        observation the mean of its *available future* ones, scaled so the
        transformed errors stay serially uncorrelated. Prefer it on gappy
        panels — first differencing destroys the equations on both sides of
        a hole, forward deviations only the one at the hole. Matches
        ``xtabond2, orthogonal`` (difference and system, one- and two-step).
    time_dummies : bool, default False
        Add period dummies (first period dropped) as regressors *and* as
        their own standard instruments. Roodman (2009) recommends these as
        a default: they absorb common shocks, which is what makes the
        no-cross-sectional-dependence assumption behind the moment
        conditions plausible.
    cluster : str, optional
        Column to cluster the standard errors on, instead of the panel unit.
        The moment conditions are summed within a unit by construction, so
        the cluster must be at least as **coarse** as the unit (industry,
        region, cohort) and constant within it; a finer variable raises.
        Only the meat of the sandwich re-groups — the one-step weight
        ``(Z'HZ)^{-1}`` stays a within-unit object because ``H`` encodes the
        serial structure the transform induces. Matches
        ``xtabond2, cluster()``.
    steps : int or {'iterated', 'cue'}, optional
        Generalises ``twostep``. ``1`` and ``2`` are the one- and two-step
        estimators (``steps=2`` is exactly ``twostep=True``); an integer
        above 2 repeats the same recursion — re-estimate the moment
        covariance at the current residuals, re-solve — that many times.

        ``'iterated'`` runs the recursion to a fixed point, at which the
        coefficient vector and the weight matrix it implies are mutually
        consistent, removing the arbitrariness of stopping at two.
        ``'cue'`` is the continuously-updated estimator (Hansen, Heaton &
        Yaron 1996), which re-evaluates the weight *inside* the objective
        and so never depends on preliminary residuals at all — the
        dependence the Windmeijer correction exists to patch. CUE optimises
        a non-convex objective numerically; ``converged`` is reported in
        ``model_info``.

        Passing both ``twostep`` and ``steps`` raises. On a heavily
        over-identified fit the iterated and CUE estimates can sit well away
        from the two-step one; that is information about the instrument set,
        not noise.
    iter_tol, iter_maxiter : float, int
        Convergence tolerance on the maximum coefficient change, and the
        iteration cap, for ``steps='iterated'`` / ``'cue'``. Failure to
        converge warns rather than silently returning the last iterate.
    ah_instrument : {'levels', 'differences'}, default 'levels'
        Which Anderson-Hsiao instrument to use for ``method='ah'``:
        ``y_{t-2}`` in levels, or its first difference ``Δy_{t-2}``. The
        differences variant costs one further period of data (it reaches
        back to ``y_{t-3}``) and is usually the weaker instrument, but it is
        valid under slightly weaker assumptions about the initial
        conditions. Ignored for the other methods.
    constant : bool, optional
        Include an intercept. Defaults to ``True`` for ``method='system'``
        (where the level equation identifies it, as in ``xtabond2``) and
        ``False`` for ``method='difference'`` (where it differences away);
        requesting it for difference GMM raises ``NotImplementedError``.
    h : {1, 2, 3}, default 3
        ``xtabond2``'s ``h()``: the a-priori error covariance weighting the
        one-step moments. ``3`` is ``[[MM', M], [M', I]]``; ``2`` zeroes the
        cross quadrants for system GMM (DPD for Ox, and Stata's
        ``xtdpdsys``); ``1`` is the identity (one-step GMM becomes 2SLS).
    iv_equation : {'both', 'diff', 'level'}, optional
        Which equation(s) the strictly exogenous regressors instrument in
        system GMM. ``None`` means ``'both'`` -- ``xtabond2``'s ``iv()``
        default, one combined column; Stata's ``xtdpdsys`` uses ``'diff'``
        (``D.x`` in the differenced equation only). Ignored for difference
        GMM.

    Returns
    -------
    CausalResult
        ``estimate`` / ``se`` are the lagged-Y (ρ₁) coefficient. ``detail``
        carries the per-coefficient table (lagged Y first, then exogenous
        regressors, then predetermined, endogenous, time dummies and — for
        system GMM — ``_cons``).

        ``model_info`` holds the diagnostics: ``n_obs`` (transformed-equation
        rows for difference GMM, level-equation rows for system GMM — the
        counts ``xtabond`` and ``xtabond2`` respectively print, with
        ``n_obs_diff`` / ``n_obs_level`` / ``n_obs_total`` always available),
        ``n_instruments``, the AR(1)/AR(2) Arellano-Bond statistics, the
        Sargan test (valid under homoskedasticity) and the Hansen J
        (heteroskedasticity-robust, reported for one-step fits too).

        The Sargan statistic uses ``xtabond``'s scale
        ``σ̂² = ê*'ê* / (2 (N* − k))`` over the *transformed* rows only
        (level residuals still contain α_i and carry no information about
        σ²). ``xtabond2`` divides by ``2 N*`` instead, so its Sargan sits a
        factor ``N*/(N* − k)`` higher; the Hansen J, which has no such free
        scale, matches ``xtabond2`` exactly.

    Notes
    -----
    **Arellano-Bond (1991)**: First-differences the equation to remove
    fixed effects α_i, then uses lagged levels Y_{i,t-2}, Y_{i,t-3}, ...
    as a block-diagonal set of GMM instruments for ΔY_{i,t-1}.

    No constant / time trend is included (unlike Stata's *default*
    ``xtabond``, which adds a ``_cons`` via a level moment). This matches
    Stata's ``xtabond ..., noconstant``; the reported ρ / β coefficients
    are identical to Stata's ``_cons`` run when the series has no drift.

    **Missing values are handled per variable, not per row.** A covariate
    that is unobserved at period *t* costs only the equations that need it;
    ``y_{i,t}`` remains available as a GMM instrument and as a lag source.
    (Before v1.21 a listwise ``dropna`` deleted the whole row, which
    amputated the instrument set whenever a lagged regressor was used — on
    ``abdata`` that moved ρ̂ from 0.849 to 0.660. See ``MIGRATION.md``.)

    **Balanced vs gapped panels.** Coefficients, standard errors, the
    Sargan/Hansen tests and the AR(1)/AR(2) tests are validated to machine
    precision against Stata for balanced panels, ragged-but-gap-free panels,
    and panels with *interior* gaps alike. A warning is emitted on gapped
    panels, but it is an efficiency advisory only: first differencing loses
    two equations per hole where forward orthogonal deviations lose one, so
    ``orthogonal=True`` is usually preferable there.

    When cross-checking a gapped panel against ``xtabond2``, write the
    instrument set on the level — ``gmm(y, lag(a b))``, matching
    ``gmm_lags=(a, b)`` — rather than on a lagged expression such as
    ``gmm(L.y, lag(a-1 b-1))``. The two are the same moment set on a
    gap-free panel and different once the panel has holes, because Stata
    materialises ``L.y`` row by row before ``xtabond2`` lags it again.

    Key diagnostics:
    - **AR(1) test**: Should reject (expected in first differences).
    - **AR(2) test**: Should NOT reject (validates instrument exogeneity).
    - **Sargan / Hansen test**: Should NOT reject (overidentification).
      Sargan (one-step) is not robust to heteroskedasticity; prefer the
      two-step Hansen J when that is a concern.
    - **Instrument count**: reported in ``model_info['n_instruments']``;
      a warning fires when it reaches the number of units.

    See Roodman (2009, *Stata Journal*) for practical guidance.

    Blundell-Bond (1998) system GMM for dynamic panels.

    Thin alias for ``sp.xtabond(..., method='system')``, named after Stata's
    ``xtdpdsys`` so the estimator is discoverable under the name applied
    researchers already use. Every keyword of :func:`xtabond` is accepted.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data, y, x, id, time, lags, gmm_lags, twostep, robust, alpha
        As in :func:`xtabond`.
    **kwargs
        Forwarded to :func:`xtabond` — ``predetermined``, ``endogenous``,
        ``collapse``, ``time_dummies``, ``constant``, and the instrument
        lag windows.

    Returns
    -------
    CausalResult
        As :func:`xtabond`, including the ``_cons`` row the level equation
        identifies.

    Notes
    -----
    System GMM stacks the level equation alongside the first-differenced
    one and instruments it with lagged differences. It is the right default
    when the dependent variable is persistent — the case in which the
    lagged levels that difference GMM relies on are weak instruments and
    the estimate collapses toward (or past) unity.

    The extra moments buy that power at the price of an extra assumption:
    the deviation of each unit's initial condition from its long-run mean
    must be uncorrelated with the fixed effect. Test it — the level
    instruments have their own difference-in-Hansen statistic.

    Defaults reproduce Stata's own ``xtdpdsys``: the strictly exogenous
    regressors instrument the differenced equation only
    (``iv_equation='diff'``) and the one-step weight uses ``h=2``. That is
    ``xtabond2 ..., gmm(L.y) iv(x, eq(diff)) h(2)``; pass
    ``iv_equation='both', h=3`` for ``xtabond2``'s own defaults, which
    ``sp.xtabond(method='system')`` keeps. Validated against Stata 18's
    ``xtdpdsys`` (one-step robust and classical, two-step Windmeijer) and
    against ``xtabond2`` under both conventions on ``abdata``; see
    ``tests/reference_parity/test_dynpanel_abdata_parity.py``.

    .. versionchanged:: 1.28.0
       ``xtdpdsys`` used ``xtabond2``'s defaults (exogenous regressors in
       both equations, ``h(3)``), so it did not reproduce the Stata command
       it is named after: on ``abdata`` the lagged-dependent coefficient was
       0.686 where ``xtdpdsys`` reports 0.542. The old estimate is
       ``sp.xtdpdsys(..., iv_equation='both', h=3)``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import statspai as sp
    >>> res = sp.xtdpdsys(df, y='n', x=['w', 'k'], id='id',      # doctest: +SKIP
    ...                   time='year', twostep=True, collapse=True)

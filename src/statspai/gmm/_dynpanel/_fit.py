    """Flag units missing an *interior* period of the dependent variable.

    This is an efficiency advisory, not a parity caveat. First differencing
    destroys two equations per hole (the difference *at* the missing period
    and the one *after* it); forward orthogonal deviations destroy one, so
    ``orthogonal=True`` is usually the better transform on a holed panel.

    Parity with Stata is exact here. An earlier version of this warning
    claimed the one-step weight matrix used a different gap convention and
    that coefficients differed from ``xtabond2`` by 2-6%. That was wrong,
    and the mistake is worth recording because it was a *reference* bug that
    read as an estimator bug: the fixture wrote the instrument set as
    ``gmm(L.n, lag(k k))``, and on a gapped panel that is not the same
    moment set as ``gmm(n, lag(k+1 k+1))``. Stata materialises the
    expression ``L.n`` row by row, so it is missing wherever the preceding
    row is absent, and ``xtabond2`` then lags that already-holed series —
    the instrument ends up needing both period ``t-k-1`` and period ``t-k``
    to exist. The two forms coincide on gap-free panels, which is why every
    other spec agreed.

    Against the level form, which is what ``gmm_lags`` actually names,
    StatsPAI matches ``xtabond2`` on holed panels to 1e-12 across
    one-step, two-step Windmeijer, FOD, system GMM and multi-regressor
    designs — see the ``I*`` specs in
    ``tests/reference_parity/_fixtures/_generate_dynpanel_stata.do``.

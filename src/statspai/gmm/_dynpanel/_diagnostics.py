"""Specification diagnostics for dynamic-panel GMM.

Three families, and all three are load-bearing rather than decorative:

* **Arellano-Bond AR(1)/AR(2)**.  First-differencing induces MA(1) by
  construction, so AR(1) *should* reject; AR(2) rejecting is evidence that
  the level errors are serially correlated, which invalidates the lagged
  levels used as instruments.
* **Sargan** (one-step, homoskedastic) and **Hansen J** (two-step,
  heteroskedasticity-robust) over-identification tests.
* **Instrument-count guardrail**.  Instrument proliferation is the dominant
  practical failure mode: with full lag depth the moment count grows as
  O(T²), overfits the endogenous regressor, biases the estimate toward the
  (Nickell-biased) within estimator, and drives the Hansen p-value toward
  1.0 — where it looks *reassuring* while being uninformative.  Roodman
  (2009) recommends keeping the instrument count below the number of units
  and always reporting it.

    ``m = (q'ê) / sqrt(Var)`` where ``q`` carries, for each row at period
    ``p``, the same unit's residual at ``p - order`` (0 when unavailable).
    The variance uses the influence-function adjustment for the estimated
    coefficients,

        ``c = q − Z A (Z'W) Minv (W'q)``,

    with a clustered outer-product variance ``Σ_i (c_i'ê_i)²`` when
    ``robust``, else the homoskedastic ``σ̂² Σ_i c_i' H_i c_i``.

    ``eq_mask`` restricts which stacked rows may supply a residual pair.
    Under system GMM the test still concerns serial correlation in the
    *first-differenced* errors, so only the transformed rows participate;
    the influence-function adjustment nevertheless runs over the full
    stacked system because that is what the coefficients were estimated on.

    **Coefficient-variance term.**  Expanding the clustered sum shows that
    the third of Arellano & Bond's (1991) three variance terms is exactly
    ``(W'q)' Avar(β̂) (W'q)`` with ``Avar(β̂)`` the *uncorrected* robust
    sandwich.  Whenever the reported VCE is a different one — the two-step
    Windmeijer correction, or the conventional two-step ``(W'ZA₂Z'W)^{-1}``
    — that term has to be swapped for the reported VCE, or the test
    silently uses a variance the estimate does not:

        ``Var = Σ_i (c_i'ê_i)² − (W'q)' V_naive (W'q) + (W'q)' V_reported (W'q)``.

    Pass ``coef_vcov`` (reported) and ``naive_vcov`` (the robust sandwich at
    the final weight and residuals) to enable it; when they coincide — the
    one-step robust case — the swap is identically zero.  Without it, the
    two-step AR statistic on ``abdata`` is -4.32 where Stata reports -3.10.

    Validated to machine precision against Stata's ``estat abond`` for
    one-step robust, one-step classical, two-step conventional and two-step
    Windmeijer-corrected estimation.

    For a subset ``S`` of moment conditions, refit the model *without*
    ``S``, take its Hansen J, and difference:

        ``C = J_full − J_excluding``   with   ``df = |S|``,

    which is asymptotically chi-squared under the null that ``S`` is
    exogenous.

    The restricted fit must reuse the **full** model's moment covariance —
    ``A_restricted = (Ω[keep, keep])^{-1}`` rather than a freshly estimated
    ``Ω`` on the reduced instrument set.  That is what guarantees the two J
    statistics are on a common scale and therefore that ``C ≥ 0`` in
    population (Hayashi 2000; Baum, Schaffer & Stillman 2003).  Re-estimating
    ``Ω`` instead is a natural-looking mistake that inflates the statistic
    badly — on ``abdata`` it turns xtabond2's 5.32 (p = 0.62, level
    instruments look fine) into 18.63 (p = 0.009, level instruments look
    rejected), i.e. it reverses the conclusion.

    This is the only way to interrogate the extra assumptions a moment set
    brings — most importantly system GMM's level moments, whose validity
    requires that each unit's deviation from its long-run mean be
    uncorrelated with the fixed effect. Reporting a system-GMM estimate
    without it is reporting an untested identifying assumption.

    Matches ``xtabond2``'s "Difference-in-Hansen tests of exogeneity of
    instrument subsets" block.

    Notes
    -----
    The statistic can come out negative in finite samples when the
    excluded-instrument weight matrix is ill-conditioned; ``xtabond2``
    warns about the same thing.  Negative values are reported as-is rather
    than clipped — silently flooring at zero would hide the conditioning
    problem that produced them.

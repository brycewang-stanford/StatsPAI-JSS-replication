"""Structured degradation tracking for the workflow / paper layer.

The orchestration code in :mod:`statspai.workflow.paper` and
:mod:`statspai.workflow.causal_workflow` historically wrapped optional
sub-steps (CI rendering, DAG appendix, citation extraction, provenance
attachment, the optional ``compare_estimators / sensitivity_panel /
cate`` pipeline tail) in ``try / except Exception: pass``.  That keeps a
single broken sub-step from crashing the whole pipeline, but it also
silently weakens the artifact: a paper draft can lose its CI, its DAG,
or its references and the user gets no signal.

This module gives those sites a uniform replacement that satisfies
CLAUDE.md §3.7 ("失败要响亮"):

* ``WorkflowDegradedWarning`` is emitted via :func:`warnings.warn`, so
  the failure shows up in pytest, in notebooks, and in CLI output.
* The exception payload is appended to ``target.degradations`` (a list
  of dicts) when ``target`` exposes such an attribute, so downstream
  consumers (``PaperDraft``, ``CausalWorkflow``) can introspect what
  was skipped and why without re-running the pipeline.

This is **not** a substitute for raising in the numerical core — it is
purely for the orchestration glue where best-effort fallback is the
desired UX.

    Parameters
    ----------
    target
        Where to record the entry.  Three accepted shapes:

        * an object with a ``degradations`` list attribute (typically a
          :class:`PaperDraft` or :class:`CausalWorkflow`) — the entry is
          appended to that list;
        * a bare ``list`` — the entry is appended directly;
        * ``None`` — only the warning fires, nothing is stored.
    section
        Human-readable label for what was being attempted, e.g.
        ``"covariate balance table"`` or ``"causal DAG appendix"``.
        Used both in the warning message and as the ``section`` key of
        the recorded entry.
    exc
        The caught exception.
    detail
        Optional extra context (for instance the column name that
        triggered the failure).  Surfaced in the warning message and
        stored under ``detail`` in the recorded entry.
    stacklevel
        Forwarded to :func:`warnings.warn` so the warning points at the
        caller of ``record_degradation``, not at this module.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        The entry that was (or would have been) appended.  Always
        returned so callers can include it in unit-test assertions.

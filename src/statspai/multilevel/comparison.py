"""
Model-comparison helpers for mixed-effects models.

``lrtest`` performs a likelihood-ratio test between two nested fits of
``mixed()`` / ``meglm()``.  When the difference lies purely in the
number of variance components being tested, the asymptotic reference
distribution is a mixture of chi-squareds (χ̄²) rather than a plain
χ² — we apply the Self–Liang (1987) 50/50 mixture correction
automatically for single-component boundary tests.

For *multi-component* variance boundary tests the correct reference
distribution is the Stram–Lee (1994, *Biometrics* 50: 1171) finite
mixture of χ² distributions whose weights depend on the specific
covariance parameterisation (`unstructured` adds both variances and
covariances, each with different boundary behaviour).  Implementing the
general Stram–Lee mixture requires enumerating the sub-models with
different sets of components on the boundary; we currently fall back to
a *conservative* 0.5·(χ²_{df-1} + χ²_df) tail and warn — this is at
worst anti-conservative only when the full χ²_df tail would be.

    """
    Likelihood-ratio test comparing a *restricted* and a *full* model.

    Parameters
    ----------
    restricted, full
        Two fitted mixed models.  ``full`` should strictly nest
        ``restricted`` — i.e. the parameter space of the restricted
        model is a subset of the full model's.
    boundary
        Whether to apply the χ̄² boundary correction.  When ``None``
        (default) we infer it from whether the restriction touches a
        variance component — the only parameters that live on the
        boundary of their support.  ``boundary=False`` reproduces Stata's
        ``lrtest`` and R's ``anova()`` (naive χ²(df) tail; Stata prints a
        note that the test is conservative when the null is on the
        boundary).  The degrees of freedom are the difference in the
        number of estimated parameters (Stata ``e(k)``), which counts every
        variance and covariance parameter.

    Returns
    -------
    LRTestResult

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the two fits have different response families (e.g. one is
        binomial, the other Poisson) — their log-likelihoods are not
        comparable and a naive LR statistic is meaningless.
    ValueError
        If either fit used REML and the fixed-effect design differs
        between the two models.  REML log-likelihoods are only
        comparable across fits that share the same fixed-effect design
        matrix; always use ML for LR tests of fixed effects.

"""
Bayesian causal inference (``statspai.bayes``).

PyMC-backed Bayesian estimators for the canonical causal designs.
PyMC and ArviZ are **optional** dependencies — importing this
sub-package never imports them. Each estimator resolves PyMC at call
time and raises :class:`ImportError` with the install recipe if the
extras are missing.

Install with:

    pip install "statspai[bayes]"

Available estimators:

- :func:`bayes_did` — 2×2 and panel difference-in-differences with
  optional hierarchical random effects on unit / time.
- :func:`bayes_rd` — sharp regression discontinuity with local
  polynomial + Normal prior on the jump.

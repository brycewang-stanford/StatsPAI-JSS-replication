"""
Bandwidth selection for local polynomial RD estimation.

This module is the public entry point ``sp.rdbwselect``. The arithmetic
lives in :mod:`statspai.rd._cct_bandwidth`, which is the same
Calonico-Cattaneo-Titiunik three-stage cascade ``sp.rdrobust`` uses to
pick its own default bandwidth, so the two cannot disagree.

They did until 1.27.0. This file used to carry a complete second
implementation -- a single-step rule of thumb, roughly 600 lines of it --
and ``sp.rdbwselect`` called that one while the estimator called the
cascade. The rule of thumb returned bandwidths 2.8x to 4.8x too narrow and
did not vary with the polynomial order, because its exponent 1/5 equals
CCT's 1/(2p+3) only at p == 1. It has been removed rather than deprecated:
keeping a known-wrong implementation of a quantity that already has a
right one in the same subpackage is what produced the defect.

All ten selectors ``rdrobust`` offers are supported, including the
``sum`` forms that ``comb1`` / ``comb2`` are defined in terms of. Sharp
RD, covariate adjustment and cluster-robust variance are supported;
covariates collinear with the running variable are refused rather than
silently absorbed (see :func:`statspai.rd._core._check_covariate_rank`).

    Bandwidth selection for local polynomial RD estimation.

    Runs the Calonico-Cattaneo-Titiunik three-stage cascade and returns all
    ten MSE-optimal and CER-optimal selectors ``rdrobust`` offers.
    MSE-optimal bandwidths minimize the mean squared error of the RD point
    estimator, while CER-optimal bandwidths minimize the coverage error
    rate of robust bias-corrected confidence intervals.

    This is the same code path ``sp.rdrobust`` uses to pick its own default
    bandwidth, so a value read here and passed back as ``h=`` reproduces
    ``sp.rdrobust``'s default fit exactly. Pinned against
    ``rdrobust::rdbwselect`` (R) and the ``rdbwselect`` ado (Stata) by Track
    A module ``88_rdbwselect`` to 1.8e-12 and 3.7e-9 respectively, across
    all ten selectors, polynomial orders 1-3, three kernels, covariate
    adjustment, clustering and the regression-kink derivative.

    .. versionchanged:: 1.27.0
       Both properties above are new. This function previously ran a
       separate single-step rule of thumb and returned bandwidths 2.8x-4.8x
       too narrow, and the four ``comb`` selectors resolved to the plain
       ``rd`` cascade. See MIGRATION.md — results should be recomputed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : pd.DataFrame
        Input dataset.
    y : str
        Outcome variable column name.
    x : str
        Running variable column name.
    c : float, default 0
        RD cutoff value.
    fuzzy : str, optional
        Treatment variable name for fuzzy RD. The MSE being minimised is
        then the one for the Wald ratio rather than for the reduced form,
        so every stage of the cascade changes.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.27.0
           This argument was parsed and then discarded: it was never passed
           to the bandwidth cascade, so ``fuzzy=`` returned the sharp
           bandwidth while the docstring claimed otherwise. On a two-sided
           noncompliance replica of the Lee 2008 senate data that is a 9%
           to 16% error in ``h``. Designs with **one-sided** noncompliance
           were unaffected, because ``rdbwselect`` itself falls back to the
           sharp bandwidth there (R's ``perf_comp``) -- which is also why
           the defect survived: the fixture in the repository was one-sided.
    deriv : int, default 0
        Derivative order. 0 = standard RD (jump in level),
        1 = regression kink design (change in slope).
    p : int, default 1
        Polynomial order for point estimation (1 = local linear).
    q : int, optional
        Polynomial order for bias correction. Default is p + 1.
    covs : list of str, optional
        Covariate column names. When provided, the variance estimates
        used in bandwidth selection account for covariate adjustment,
        typically yielding narrower bandwidths.
    kernel : str, default 'triangular'
        Kernel function: 'triangular', 'uniform', or 'epanechnikov'.
    bwselect : str, default 'mserd'
        Bandwidth selection method. One of:

        - ``'mserd'`` : MSE-optimal common bandwidth (default)
        - ``'msetwo'`` : MSE-optimal separate left/right bandwidths
        - ``'msesum'`` : MSE-optimal for the sum of the two intercepts
        - ``'msecomb1'`` : ``min(mserd, msesum)``, per side
        - ``'msecomb2'`` : ``median(msetwo, mserd, msesum)``, per side
        - ``'cerrd'``, ``'certwo'``, ``'cersum'``, ``'cercomb1'``,
          ``'cercomb2'`` : the CER-optimal counterparts of the above

        The combination rules are applied to the finished ``h`` and ``b``
        of each cascade, element-wise per side -- not stage by stage.
    cluster : str, optional
        Cluster variable name for cluster-robust variance estimation.
    all : bool, default False
        If True, compute and return all ten bandwidth types.

    Returns
    -------
    pd.DataFrame
        DataFrame with columns ``[method, h_left, h_right, b_left, b_right,
        n_left, n_right]``. When ``all=False``, contains a single row for
        the selected method. When ``all=True``, contains ten rows, one
        per method.

    Notes
    -----
    The CER-optimal bandwidth is related to the MSE-optimal bandwidth by:

        h_CER = h_MSE * n^{-1/((2p+3)(2p+5))}

    For p=1 (local linear), this gives h_CER ~ h_MSE * n^{-1/35}, which
    is strictly narrower than h_MSE. The narrower bandwidth yields
    confidence intervals with better coverage properties at the cost of
    slightly wider intervals.

    The MSE-optimal bandwidth has rate n^{-1/(2p+3)} while the CER rate
    is n^{-1/(2p+3) - 1/((2p+3)(2p+5))}. For large samples the
    difference is meaningful: CER bandwidths produce robust CIs that
    achieve their nominal coverage rate, whereas MSE bandwidths can
    exhibit substantial coverage distortion.

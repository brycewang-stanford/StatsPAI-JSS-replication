"""Single source of truth for the parity systems' shared vocabulary.

Two independent subsystems used to keep private copies of the same two
tables and drifted apart:

* :mod:`statspai.registry` derived ``validation_status`` from a hand-written
  Track A alias table plus a scan of ``tests/reference_parity``.
* ``scripts/build_parity_index.py`` derived the parity grade from the
  committed Track A / reference-parity / external-parity artifacts, with a
  *second*, differently-populated alias table and its own non-estimator
  exclusion set.

The result was a reconciliation gap in both directions (the registry
under-stated 85 functions that had cross-language evidence and over-stated
3 that did not) and — worse — a circular citation: the index credited an
alias because "the registry marks it certified", while the registry marked
it certified because of its own hand-written table. Neither side held an
artifact. CLAUDE.md §10 forbids exactly that.

This module holds both tables once. Every alias entry names the pytest that
*proves* the equivalence on the committed Track A bytes, so "alias of a
certified module" is an auditable claim rather than an assertion.

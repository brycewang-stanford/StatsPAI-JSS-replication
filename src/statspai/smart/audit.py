"""Reviewer-checklist audit of a fitted StatsPAI result.

``sp.audit(result)`` returns the *missing-evidence* view of a result:
which robustness / sensitivity / diagnostic checks a careful reviewer
would expect for this estimator family — and which of those have
already been run vs. are still missing on the result.

Distinct from neighbouring methods:

* :meth:`CausalResult.violations` — items already on ``model_info`` whose
  values *fail* their threshold ("checked but failed").
* :meth:`CausalResult.next_steps` — recommendations of what to *do next*,
  oriented around action (export, robustness, alternative method).
* :func:`statspai.smart.assumption_audit` — heavyweight: takes
  ``(result, data)`` and *re-runs* statistical tests. ``audit`` is
  pure introspection — it never re-runs anything, never touches data,
  and runs in microseconds.

The agent's mental model: ``audit`` answers "what evidence is missing
for a reviewer to trust this estimate?"; ``assumption_audit`` answers
"given the data, do the assumptions actually hold?".

Returns an :class:`AuditReport`, a ``dict`` subclass, so MCP-mediated
agents can branch on the ``status`` field of each check without parsing
prose while a human at a prompt still gets a readable checklist instead
of a screenful of nested Python literals.

class _Check:
    """One reviewer-relevant check the result either has or lacks.

    Attributes
    ----------
    name : str
        Short identifier — agents branch on this.
    question : str
        Reviewer-style human-readable prompt.
    applies_to : tuple[str, ...]
        Method families (per :func:`statspai.core.next_steps._detect_family`)
        for which this check is relevant.
    evidence_paths : tuple[tuple[str, ...], ...]
        Candidate paths of keys into ``result.model_info`` where the
        evidence would live. A *tuple of paths* — the first one that
        resolves wins — so estimators that store the same diagnostic
        under different aliases all surface as ``passed``.
    threshold : float | None
        Numeric threshold used to decide passed vs. failed when the
        evidence value is a number. ``None`` for existence-only checks.
    compare : str
        How to evaluate the value vs. the threshold:

        - ``"greater_passes"`` — value > threshold → passed
        - ``"less_passes"``    — value < threshold → passed
        - ``"abs_less_passes"`` — abs(value) < threshold → passed
                                  (two-sided magnitude, e.g. Heckman rho).
        - ``"exists"``          — non-empty dict at the path → passed.
                                   Strict-dict-only intentionally — a
                                   bare ``False`` / ``0`` / ``""``
                                   sentinel must NOT mark the check
                                   passed. The estimator contract is
                                   to write a sub-dict (e.g.
                                   ``{"pvalue": 0.5}`` or
                                   ``{"has_run": True}``) when a
                                   diagnostic has actually been
                                   computed.
        - ``"not_nonrobust"``   — robust SE flag is set to anything but
                                   ``"nonrobust"`` → passed
    suggest_function : str | None
        ``sp.xxx`` to run when this check is missing.
    importance : str
        ``"high"`` / ``"medium"`` / ``"low"`` — how badly missing this
        check undermines the conclusion. Constant per check; the
        output ``importance`` field always carries this value
        regardless of status, so agents can do
        ``if c["importance"] == "high"`` without worrying about the
        status branch.
    rationale : str
        One-sentence reviewer justification: *why* this check matters.
    model_type_any : tuple[str, ...]
        Optional model-type gate. When non-empty, the check applies only if
        one of these substrings appears in the result's model_type / method
        signature (case-insensitive). Lets a family-level pool carry a check
        that is specific to one estimator within the family — e.g. the
        proportional-hazards check lives in the regression pool but must fire
        only for Cox, never for a plain OLS. Empty (the default) means the
        check applies to every result its ``applies_to`` family admits.
    requires_evidence : tuple[str, ...]
        Optional data-presence gate. When non-empty, the check is only
        included if the result actually has the data needed to evaluate
        the assumption — i.e. one of the listed keys is present in the
        result's ``model_info`` (or in the merged ``diagnostics``).
        Empty (the default) means the check applies to every result its
        ``applies_to`` family admits.
        The motivating use case is MCMC convergence: asking "did your
        rhat converge?" on a frequentist MLE that has no sampler is
        noise; ``requires_evidence=("rhat_max", "ess_bulk_min", ...)``
        keeps the check live only on results that could actually report
        it. The same mechanism generalises — e.g.
        ``requires_evidence=("n_clusters",)`` for a "few clusters"
        sanity check that should only appear on clustered fits.
        When the key alone is insufficient (e.g. a method whose evidence
        is implied by a Bayesian / MCMC signature rather than a stored
        scalar), ``requires_signature`` adds a string-substring check
        against ``method + model_type``. Both gates are OR'd.
    requires_signature : tuple[str, ...]
        Optional method-signature gate, paired with ``requires_evidence``.
        The check is included if EITHER the evidence gate is satisfied
        OR any of these substrings appears in the method/model_type
        signature (case-insensitive). Used by Bayesian convergence to
        keep the check live on results that report a Bayesian method
        but have not yet written rhat evidence (e.g. an in-progress
        fit, or one that ran the sampler in a different code path).
    applicability : str | None
        Optional name of a statistical-applicability rule in
        :data:`_APPLICABILITY_RULES`. The gates above decide whether a
        check is *listed*; this rule decides whether a listed check can
        be *asked* of this particular fit. When the rule returns a reason
        (e.g. an over-identification test on a just-identified IV fit,
        which has no over-identifying restriction to test), the check is
        reported with status ``"not_applicable"`` and that reason instead
        of ``"missing"`` -- so neither a human nor an agent is told to
        run a test that does not exist for the model. When the rule cannot
        decide from the stored metadata it returns ``None`` and the check
        is evaluated normally.

    Returns the *missing-evidence* view: which robustness / sensitivity /
    diagnostic checks the estimator family expects, and which of those
    are present, failed, or absent on the result.

    This is **read-only** — never re-runs a statistical test, never
    touches the original DataFrame, runs in microseconds. Pair it
    with :func:`statspai.smart.assumption_audit` (which *does* re-run
    tests against the data) when you need both perspectives.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : CausalResult or EconometricResults
        Any fitted StatsPAI result with ``model_info`` attached.
    treatment : str, optional
        Name of the treatment variable when ``result`` is a plain regression
        used for causal adjustment on a selection-on-observables design. When
        supplied, the audit additionally asks for overlap / common-support,
        post-adjustment balance, and omitted-variable sensitivity — the checks
        a referee demands on an observational design but that a bare OLS would
        otherwise escape. Has no effect on designs whose family already carries
        these checks (matching / DML / IV / …). Descriptive regressions (no

    Returns
    -------
    AuditReport
        A ``dict`` subclass -- JSON-safe and indexable exactly as before,
        but rendering as a readable checklist when printed -- with keys:

        - ``method`` (str) — the estimator's name
        - ``method_family`` (str) — one of ``"did"`` / ``"rd"`` / ``"iv"``
          / ``"synth"`` / ``"matching"`` / ``"dml"`` / ``"hte"`` /
          ``"regression"`` / ``"generic"``
        - ``checks`` (list[dict]) — every check the estimator family
          lists, each with ``name`` / ``question`` / ``status`` /
          ``severity`` / ``value`` / ``threshold`` / ``suggest_function``
          / ``rationale``. ``status`` is ``"passed"``, ``"failed"``,
          ``"missing"`` or ``"not_applicable"``; a not-applicable check
          (e.g. an over-identification test on a just-identified IV fit)
          also carries a ``reason`` and never a ``suggest_function``.
        - ``summary`` (dict) — count of ``passed`` / ``failed`` /
          ``missing`` / ``not_applicable``, and ``n_total``, the number
          of *applicable* checks (``passed + failed + missing``)

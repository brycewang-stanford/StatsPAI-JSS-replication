"""Deterministic-RNG context manager for reproducible agent loops.

``sp.session(seed=42)`` snapshots the RNG state of Python's
``random`` and NumPy's **legacy global** MT19937 generator (the one
backing ``np.random.randn``, ``np.random.choice``, etc.), applies the
new seed for the duration of the ``with`` block, and restores the
prior state on exit. Optional extras (PyTorch, JAX) are seeded only
when those libraries are already importable — never auto-installed.

What it does NOT cover
----------------------
``np.random.default_rng()`` creates a fresh PCG64 generator seeded
from OS entropy each time it is called — those generators have no
process-global state for ``sp.session`` to manipulate. If your code
calls ``rng = np.random.default_rng()`` inside the block, the draws
will be different on every run regardless of the session seed. To
get deterministic ``default_rng`` draws, pass the seed explicitly:

>>> with sp.session(seed=42) as state:
...     rng = np.random.default_rng(state.seed)   # explicit seed
...     x = rng.normal(size=5)

Threading
---------
Not thread-safe. The snapshot lives in a context-manager local but
the *target* state (Python ``random`` and NumPy legacy globals) is
process-wide. Two threads that enter ``sp.session`` simultaneously
will trample each other's snapshots and produce non-deterministic
results with no error. For parallel workloads, instantiate
``np.random.default_rng(seed)`` per-thread and thread the generator
through your call stack instead of relying on ``sp.session``.

The point: agents iterate. A bootstrap CI that drifts between calls
because different RNG state was active is a debugging nightmare.
``with sp.session(seed=42): ...`` makes every call reproducible
without polluting the global RNG state outside the block.

Usage
-----

>>> import statspai as sp
>>> import numpy as np
>>>
>>> with sp.session(seed=42):
...     a = np.random.randn(3)
...     # any sp.xxx call inside is deterministic
>>>
>>> # State outside the block is untouched.
>>> b = np.random.randn(3)  # uses prior global state

) -> Iterator[Any]:
    """Set every reachable RNG to a known seed for the duration of the
    ``with`` block, then restore the prior state on exit.

    Parameters
    ----------
    seed : int, optional
        Seed value. ``None`` (the default) means "snapshot current
        state but don't reseed" — useful for opportunistic save /
        restore around code that you don't want to leak RNG drift.
    torch : bool, default ``True``
        Seed PyTorch (CPU + CUDA) when the library is already
        imported. Never imports torch on its own.
    jax : bool, default ``True``
        Yield a fresh JAX ``PRNGKey(seed)`` to the caller via the
        ``jax_key`` attribute on the yielded session object, when
        JAX is already imported. Never imports jax on its own.
        (JAX has no global state so we can't seed it — agents must
        thread the key explicitly.)
    pythonhashseed : bool, default ``False``
        Set ``PYTHONHASHSEED`` for the duration of the block. Most
        causal-inference numerics don't depend on dict iteration
        order, but spec-curve enumerators and graph-based DAG search
        sometimes do. Off by default to avoid surprising downstream
        callers.

    Yields
    ------
    SessionState
        Object exposing the seed in use as ``.seed`` and (when JAX
        is imported) a ``.jax_key`` PRNGKey. Tests / agents can hold
        a reference to verify the seed inside the block.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np, statspai as sp
    >>> with sp.session(seed=42):
    ...     a = np.random.randn(3)
    >>> with sp.session(seed=42):
    ...     b = np.random.randn(3)
    >>> bool((a == b).all())
    True

    Notes
    -----
    Restoration is best-effort: if a library was lazily imported
    INSIDE the ``with`` block (and thus had no prior state), the
    exit handler skips restoring it. The intended use is small,
    deterministic blocks of estimator + bootstrap calls — not
    long-running session orchestration.

"""Auto-generated "Methods and Formulas" appendix for fitted results.

Stata's manuals ship a *Methods and Formulas* section for every estimator;
R packages anchor theirs to a JSS paper. For a tool that aspires to *write*
the paper, the killer feature is that **every reported number traces back to
(i) the estimand / estimator definition, (ii) the inference actually used, and
(iii) a verified citation** — so a referee can audit the methodology without
trusting the implementation blind.

This module is the engineering arm of that goal. Given a fitted
:class:`~statspai.core.results.CausalResult` it emits a compact methods
appendix that a careful econometrics referee would accept:

* **Estimand / estimator** — hand-curated, textbook-standard LaTeX definitions
  (e.g. the 2x2 DiD double difference, the sharp-RD limit contrast, the
  Imbens–Angrist Wald/LATE ratio). These are stored, never generated, mirroring
  the zero-hallucination policy of :data:`CausalResult._CITATIONS` (CLAUDE.md
  §10). An unregistered method degrades to an explicit ``(methods text not yet
  registered)`` placeholder — never an invented formula.

* **Inference** — read off the *actual* fitted object
  (``model_info['se_method']``, cluster variables, bootstrap replications,
  bandwidth, first-stage F, ...) plus the universal ``se`` / ``ci`` / ``pvalue``.
  Reporting the SE *method that the code ran* — rather than transcribing a
  sandwich formula that might not match — is both more honest and the whole
  point of "traceability".

* **Citation** — pulled from ``result.cite(...)``, which itself reads the
  single-source ``_CITATIONS`` table / ``paper.bib``. Methods text and citation
  resolve through the *same* key logic, so they stay in lockstep.

Notes
-----
The estimand / estimator formulas below are standard definitions from the
cited primary sources; standard-error *math* is deliberately **not** transcribed
(it is reported via the method recorded on the result instead) to avoid drift
between the appendix and the implementation.

Examples
--------
>>> import statspai as sp
>>> import numpy as np
>>> import pandas as pd
>>> rng = np.random.default_rng(0)
>>> ids = np.repeat(np.arange(40), 2)
>>> time = np.tile([0, 1], 40)
>>> treat = (ids >= 20).astype(int)
>>> y = 1.0 + 2.0 * treat * time + rng.normal(size=len(ids))
>>> df = pd.DataFrame({"id": ids, "time": time, "treat": treat, "y": y})
>>> res = sp.did(df, y="y", treat="treat", time="time", id="id")
>>> txt = sp.methods_appendix(res, format="markdown")
>>> "Estimand" in txt

    For each fitted result, emits the estimand and estimator definitions
    (verified LaTeX from the cited source), the identifying assumptions, the
    inference actually used (read off the fitted object), and the canonical
    citation. Multiple results sharing the same estimator family are emitted
    once. Unregistered methods degrade to an explicit placeholder — never an
    invented formula (CLAUDE.md §10).

    Parameters
    ----------
    results : CausalResult or sequence of CausalResult
        One or more fitted result objects exposing ``method`` / ``model_info``
        / ``cite``.
    format : {"latex", "markdown", "text"}, default ``"latex"``
        Output format. ``"latex"`` emits ``\\subsection*`` blocks with display
        math; ``"markdown"`` emits ``###`` headings with ``$$`` math;
        ``"text"`` emits a plain-text rendering.
    include_assumptions : bool, default True
        Include the identifying-assumptions list.
    include_diagnostics : bool, default True
        Include the inference block (SE method, clustering, bandwidth, F, CI).
    include_citation : bool, default True
        Append the APA-style reference from ``result.cite()``.
    include_provenance : bool, default True
        Append a one-line provenance trace (StatsPAI version + estimator
        identity + methods-spec key) — the "exact code path" leg of the
        formula / citation / code-path traceability triple.

    Returns
    -------
    str
        The assembled appendix.

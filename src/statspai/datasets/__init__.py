"""Canonical econometrics datasets with documented expected estimates.

This subpackage provides deterministic, reproducible datasets used
throughout the causal-inference literature, consolidated under a
single import path ``sp.datasets``:

>>> import statspai as sp
>>> df = sp.datasets.nsw_lalonde()          # real extract, no network
>>> df.shape
(614, 11)
>>> sp.datasets.nsw_lalonde(simulated=True).attrs['expected_experimental_att']
1794

**One rule:** if StatsPAI ships the real published data for a dataset,
a bare call returns it. ``simulated=True`` asks for the calibrated
replica instead. ``list_datasets()['source']`` says which you get.
Nothing here touches the network — the whole catalogue works offline.

Each function returns a ``pd.DataFrame`` with:

- A fully-deterministic DGP (fixed seed, BSD/MIT redistributable).
- ``df.attrs`` containing:
  - ``'paper'`` — original paper citation
  - ``'expected_*'`` — theoretically-anchored estimates (from the
    published paper on the ORIGINAL data, not necessarily the
    simulated replica)
  - ``'notes'`` — what to be careful about when using this replica

The simulated replicas are designed to match the *structure* and
*summary statistics* of the original datasets.  For numerical R /
Stata parity against the original data, see
``tests/external_parity/PUBLISHED_REFERENCE_VALUES.md``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    simulated : bool, default False

        ``synth.california_tobacco`` (39 states × 31 years, 1970-2000,

        ``statspai/datasets/data/california_prop99.csv`` (39 states ×
        31 years, with covariates ``cigsale, retprice, lnincome,

    Columns: name, design, n_obs, paper, paper_original, expected_main,

    Every dataset here loads from disk — none of them touches the

    variant a bare ``name()`` call returns: ``"bundled CSV"`` is the real
    extract shipped in ``datasets/data/``, ``"simulated"`` a
    deterministic replica calibrated near the published estimate.

    - ``paper_original`` is the headline number from the published paper on the
      ORIGINAL data (what readers expect to see).
    - ``expected_main`` is what the canonical estimator recovers from the
      variant a bare ``name()`` call returns (what users will actually
      observe), and it is prefixed ``REAL data:`` wherever that default is
      the bundled extract rather than a replica. For a ``"simulated"`` row
      the two columns differ because the replica is a deterministic DGP
      calibrated to the neighbourhood of the published value, not the
      original data. For a ``"bundled CSV"`` row any gap is an estimator or
      extract difference and is named as such.

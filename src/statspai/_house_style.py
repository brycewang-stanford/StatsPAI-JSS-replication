"""Canonical public-API parameter vocabulary — the StatsPAI house style.

This module is the single source of truth for how inference / data / design
keyword arguments should be *spelled* across the public API.  Two consumers
read it:

* ``scripts/signature_house_style.py`` — the CI lint that flags public
  functions whose parameters use a non-canonical spelling of a known theme.
* ``statspai._aliases.accepts_aliases`` (grammar-convergence step) — the
  decorator that lets estimators accept legacy spellings while the canonical
  one becomes the documented default.

Design notes
------------
* The vocabulary is **additive and reversible** (CLAUDE.md §3 + the JSS-review
  constraint): naming a spelling "legacy" here does *not* change any runtime
  behaviour on its own.  Convergence happens later, opt-in, via the alias
  decorator — with deprecation warnings held off during JSS review.
* ``FALSE_FRIENDS`` is the critical noise-suppression layer.  Several params
  *look* like an inference/weight keyword but mean something orthogonal:

  - ``w`` / ``W`` — spatial weight matrix in spatial econometrics, and the
    EconML-mirrored treatment symbol in the CATE family.
  - ``cov_type`` — the random-effects covariance *structure* in mixed models
    (``'unstructured'`` / ``'independent'``), **not** an SE type.
  - ``group`` — a comparison/cohort group in decompositions and DiD, **not**
    a clustering variable.  (Hence ``group`` is deliberately *not* a cluster
    alias below.)
  - ``Y`` / ``T`` — EconML-mirrored outcome/treatment in ``causal_forest`` &
    friends, kept verbatim so EconML users migrate without relearning.

  Anything listed here is reported separately as "acknowledged" and never
  counted as a violation, or the lint becomes noise and gets ignored.

The canonical choices below were ratified by the maintainer (2026-06-30):
SE keyword ``vce=`` (Stata muscle memory), outcome ``y``, treatment ``treat``.

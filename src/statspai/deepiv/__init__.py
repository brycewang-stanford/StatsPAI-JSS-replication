DeepIV: Deep Learning Instrumental Variables (Hartford et al. 2017).

Uses a two-stage neural network approach:
  Stage 1: Mixture Density Network estimates P(T | Z, X)
  Stage 2: Response network minimises counterfactual loss using
           Monte-Carlo samples from the learned treatment distribution.

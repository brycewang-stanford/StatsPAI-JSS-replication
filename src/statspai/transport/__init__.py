"""
Transportability (``sp.transport``): generalize causal effects across
populations. Combines Pearl-Bareinboim identification (selection
diagrams) with Dahabreh-Stuart-style density-ratio weighting.

Quick start
-----------
>>> import statspai as sp
>>> g = sp.dag("S -> X; X -> Y; S -> Y")
>>> sp.transport.identify_transport(g, treatment="X", outcome="Y",
...                                 selection_nodes={"S"})
>>> sp.transport.weights(source=rct, target=target_df,
...                      features=["age", "sex"],
...                      treatment="treat", outcome="y")

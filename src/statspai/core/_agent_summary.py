"""
Agent-native structured views of StatsPAI result objects.

This module hosts the logic behind ``result.to_agent_summary()`` and
``result.violations()`` for both :class:`EconometricResults` and
:class:`CausalResult`.  Kept separate from ``results.py`` to avoid
bloating that file and to let the per-method rules evolve
independently of the core data model.

Design principles
-----------------

* **Non-invasive.** Neither method alters the underlying result
  object.  Callers can invoke them any number of times.
* **Structured, not prose.**  ``to_agent_summary()`` returns a
  plain ``dict`` suitable for ``json.dumps`` or direct consumption
  by an LLM tool loop.  ``violations()`` returns a list of dicts.
* **Pattern-matching, not fitting.**  Violation detection only
  *inspects* diagnostics that the estimator already stored
  (``pretrend_test``, ``rhat``, ``first_stage_f``, …). It never
  re-runs a test.

#  Thresholds (literature-based rules of thumb)
# ====================================================================== #

#: Pre-trend test p-value below which we flag a DID parallel-trends
#: concern.  Deliberately *not* 0.05: agents should treat 0.10 as
#: "warrants follow-up" per Roth (2022) on low-power pre-trend tests.
_PRETREND_ALPHA = 0.10

#: Stock-Yogo 5% bias threshold (single endogenous regressor, 2SLS).
_WEAK_IV_F = 10.0

#: Gelman-Rubin / MCMC convergence thresholds (mirrors PyMC / arviz).
_RHAT_MAX = 1.01
_ESS_MIN = 400
_DIVERGENCES_MAX = 0

#: Maximum tolerable standardized mean difference after matching (SMD). 0.10 is
#: the conventional "well balanced" target (Rosenbaum-Rubin); a match leaving
#: more than this on a covariate is not ideal but often acceptable.
_SMD_MAX = 0.10

#: Standardized mean difference above which residual imbalance is a *concern*
#: worth flagging loudly (Stuart 2010; What Works Clearinghouse). Set above
#: _SMD_MAX so the warning fires on genuinely poor matches, not borderline ones.
_SMD_IMBALANCE_MAX = 0.25

#: Propensity score overlap: treated weight share below this → bad
#: common support.
_OVERLAP_MIN = 0.05

#: DML / AIPW propensity overlap: share of units whose cross-fitted propensity
#: sits at or beyond the trimming bound (near 0 or 1). Above this the IRM /
#: AIPW estimate leans on a few near-degenerate-weight units and is unstable.
#: 0.05 fires on genuinely poor overlap (strong confounding) while clearing
#: moderate confounding, which trims essentially nothing.
_DML_OVERLAP_EXTREME_SHARE = 0.05

#: Absolute logit/probit slope coefficient above which (quasi-)complete
#: separation is the likely cause: an odds ratio of e^15 ≈ 3.3M is not a real
#: effect, it is the MLE diverging when a predictor perfectly splits the outcome
#: (Albert-Anderson 1984; Heinze-Schemper 2002). Real coefficients are O(1-5).
_LOGIT_SEPARATION_COEF = 15.0

#: Pearson dispersion (χ²/df) above which a Poisson fit is over-dispersed —
#: its variance exceeds its mean, so model-based SEs are too small. 1.5 is a
#: conservative bar (equidispersion is 1.0) that clears clean Poisson data.
_POISSON_DISPERSION_MAX = 1.5

#: Excess-zero margin: observed zero share minus the share the fitted count
#: model predicts. Above this the data has more zeros than Poisson/NB explains,
#: so a zero-inflated model (ZIP/ZINB) is warranted. 0.05 clears equidispersed
#: data (observed ≈ predicted) and fires on genuine zero inflation.
_COUNT_EXCESS_ZERO_MARGIN = 0.05

#: Heckman: |rho| this close to the ±1 boundary signals a weak exclusion
#: restriction / near-collinear inverse-Mills term — the two-step estimates are
#: unstable and hypersensitive to the specification.
_HECKMAN_RHO_BOUNDARY = 0.99

#: Heckman: inverse-Mills (lambda) p-value above which there is no detectable
#: selection — the correction is adding variance for nothing, so OLS on the
#: selected sample is consistent and more efficient.
_HECKMAN_SELECTION_P = 0.10

#: Tobit: censored share (percent) above which the likelihood is dominated by
#: the censoring point and the latent-model coefficients are fragile.
_TOBIT_CENSOR_PCT_MAX = 90.0

#: Cox: proportional-hazards test p-value below which the PH assumption is
#: rejected for some covariate (its hazard ratio changes over time).
_COX_PH_ALPHA = 0.05

#: Minimum number of clusters for cluster-robust SE to be reliable. Below this,
#: the CRVE is downward-biased and t-tests over-reject; the wild cluster
#: bootstrap (Cameron-Gelbach-Miller 2008; MacKinnon-Webb 2017) is the standard
#: remedy. 30 is the conservative end of the common 30-50 rule of thumb.
_FEW_CLUSTERS_MIN = 30

#: Few *treated* clusters. The cluster-robust variance estimates the treated
#: side's contribution from as many draws as there are treated clusters, so
#: the over-rejection is governed by that count and not by the total (Conley
#: and Taber 2011; Ferman and Pinto 2019). Ten is the point below which the
#: placebo-distribution methods of ``sp.did_few_treated`` are the safer
#: report; with one treated cluster the CRVE rejects a true null most of the
#: time whatever the number of controls.
_FEW_TREATED_MIN = 10

#: Synthetic-control pre-fit quality: pre-treatment RMSPE divided by the
#: pre-period SD of the treated outcome. Deliberately conservative (0.6 ⇒ the
#: synthetic unit explains < ~64% of pre-period variance) so it clears the
#: canonical *good* example — California Prop-99 sits at ~0.42 — and only fires
#: on genuinely poor fits (an unmatchable treated trend lands ~2.7). A poor
#: pre-fit means the synthetic control does not track the treated unit before
#: treatment, so the post-period gap cannot be read as a treatment effect.

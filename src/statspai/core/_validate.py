"""Dependency-free argument validators shared across estimator families.

Deliberately importing nothing beyond numpy and ``..exceptions``. The
first home for ``require_bool_flag`` was ``core/_vcov.py``, which reads
as the natural place for a standard-error validator — but ``_vcov``
imports ``._numba_kernels`` at module level, so routing five estimator
modules through it dragged numba into a plain ``import statspai`` and
tripped the cold-import budget. A validator has no business costing an
import; hence this module.

    highest-impact hazard in the signature surface. It was also a silent
    one: every bool-typed site accepted the string form, read it as truthy,

    is a separate ``cluster=`` argument on all of these estimators, so the

    The convention is the one ``sp.dml(fold_indices=...)`` normalises to:
    one integer label per input row, the labels being exactly
    ``0, 1, ..., K-1`` with ``K >= 2``, and row ``i`` held out when fold
    ``fold_indices[i]`` is predicted. The vector is aligned with the rows
    of the *input* data; ``keep`` (a boolean mask of the rows the
    estimator retains after dropping missing values) subsets it afterwards,
    so a caller never has to pre-compute which rows survive.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fold_indices : array-like of int, length ``n_input``
    n_input : int
        Number of rows in the data the vector is aligned with.
    context : str
        Prefix for error messages (e.g. ``"sp.tmle"``).
    keep : array-like of bool, optional
        Rows retained by the estimator.
    n_folds : int, optional
        When given, the partition must define exactly this many folds.
    binary_target : array-like, optional
        A 0/1 vector (already subset by ``keep``) that every training
        complement must contain both classes of, e.g. the treatment for a
        propensity model.

    -------
    ndarray of int
        The fold labels of the retained rows.

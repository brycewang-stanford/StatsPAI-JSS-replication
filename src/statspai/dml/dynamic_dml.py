r"""Dynamic Double/Debiased ML: heterogeneous effects of a treatment sequence.

:func:`statspai.dml_panel` assumes one homogeneous effect and a treatment
that does not move the future state. When treatment is assigned repeatedly
and *changes the confounders that drive later treatment*, that model is not
merely inefficient, it is wrong: controlling for the later state blocks the
indirect path the treatment worked through, and not controlling for it
leaves the confounding in. Robins's g-methods
(:func:`statspai.msm`, :func:`statspai.gformula`,
:func:`statspai.ltmle`) solve the population-average version;
[lewis2021double] solve it in the Neyman-orthogonal, cross-fitted way that
also gives heterogeneity and admits machine-learnt nuisances.

Estimand
--------
With ``m`` periods per unit and the outcome read at the end,

.. math::
    Y_i = \sum_{t=0}^{m-1} \theta_t(X_i)\, T_{it} + \text{(state)} + \epsilon_i

where :math:`\theta_t` is the effect of *intervening* on the treatment at
period ``t``, holding the rest of the sequence at its intervened value and
letting the state evolve. It therefore contains the indirect path through
later states, which is what a policy maker who sets the whole sequence
cares about. ``theta.sum()`` is the effect of treating in every period
rather than none.

Identification (sequential ignorability)
----------------------------------------
``T_t`` must be as good as random given the recorded state at ``t``. The
state has to include **the treatment history**. On the simulation the
tests use, dropping the one lagged treatment moved the three period
effects by -15%, -15% and +37%, and not one interval covered the truth:
``T_t`` depends on ``T_{t-1}``, which predicts the later state, so the
residualisation is incomplete without it. ``lags=1`` (the default) adds
it for you; ``lags=0`` opts out, warns, and says so in ``diagnostics``.

Estimator
---------
Stage one, cross-fitted by unit: for every period ``t`` regress the final
outcome and every present-or-future treatment ``T_j`` (``j >= t``) on the
period-``t`` state, and keep the residuals ``R_t`` and ``B_{t,j}``.

Stage two: the moment conditions are triangular,

.. math::
    \mathbb{E}\Bigl[B_{t,t}\bigl(R_t - \sum_{j \ge t}\theta_j B_{t,j}\bigr)
    \Bigr] = 0, \qquad t = m-1, \dots, 0

which [lewis2021double] solve by back-substitution, one period at a time.
Solving the stacked system instead gives the same estimate and, for free,
the **joint** sandwich covariance -- so the standard error of a sequence
effect accounts for the correlation between periods rather than adding
variances. On the test design that is the difference between 0.044 and
0.073: the blips are negatively correlated, and the total is estimated
more precisely than any single period of it: 0.032 against 0.062.

Parity
------
Given the same folds and the same first-stage learners, this reproduces
``econml.panel.dml.DynamicDML`` [econml] -- the reference implementation,
written by the authors of the method -- to 1e-15 relative on both the
per-period estimates and their standard errors
(``tests/reference_parity/test_dynamic_dml_econml_parity.py``).

    r"""Effect of a treatment *sequence*, period by period [lewis2021double].

    Use this when treatment is assigned repeatedly and moves the state that
    drives later treatment. Controlling for the later state blocks the
    indirect path; not controlling for it leaves the confounding in. The
    estimator residualises each period against the state *as of that
    period* and solves the resulting triangular moment conditions, so
    ``theta_t`` is the effect of intervening on period ``t``'s treatment
    with the rest of the sequence held at its intervened value -- the
    indirect path through later states included.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : pd.DataFrame
        Long panel, one row per unit-period. Units not observed in every
        period are dropped and counted in ``diagnostics``.
    y : str
        Outcome. Only its value in the **last** period is used: the
        estimand is the effect of the whole sequence on the final outcome.
    treat : str
        Treatment, continuous or binary.
    id, time : str
        Panel keys; ``unit=`` is accepted as an alias of ``id``, the
        spelling :func:`statspai.dml_panel` uses. ``time`` is sorted; pass
        ``periods=`` to choose a window or to fix a non-sortable order.
    covariates : list of str, optional
        Time-varying state, read at each period. This is where the
        confounders that the treatment itself moves belong.
    baseline : list of str, optional
        Time-invariant controls, added to every period's state (their
        first-period values are used).
    modifiers : list of str, optional
        Effect modifiers for heterogeneity, read at the **first** period
        (they are pre-treatment by construction). The final stage becomes
        linear in them and ``result.coef`` holds the projection.
    lags : int, default 1
        Lagged treatments added to each period's state. **The default is
        not cosmetic**: sequential ignorability needs the treatment
        history, and on the simulation behind the tests dropping the one
        lag moved the three period effects by -15%, -15% and +37% with no
        interval covering the truth. ``lags=0`` opts out, warns, and
        records it in ``diagnostics``.
    model_y, model_t : estimator, optional
        First-stage learners (scikit-learn API). Default
        ``RidgeCV(alphas=logspace(-3, 3, 13))``.
    n_folds : int, default 5
        Cross-fitting folds. Whole units are held out, never rows.
    alpha : float, default 0.05
    random_state : int, default 0
        Seeds the fold assignment.
    periods : sequence, optional
        The periods to use, in order. Defaults to every sorted value of
        ``time``.
    fold_ids : array-like, optional
        One fold index per unit (in sorted unit order), to reproduce an
        external split -- this is how the parity test matches ``econml``.

    Returns
    -------
    DynamicDMLResult
        ``.periods`` per-period effects, ``.estimate`` the total sequence
        effect, ``.vcov`` the joint covariance, ``.contrast(w)`` any
        linear combination, ``.cumulative()`` the treat-from-here-on
        profile.

    Notes
    -----
    Point estimates and standard errors reproduce
    ``econml.panel.dml.DynamicDML`` [econml] to 1e-15 relative given the
    same folds and learners; the joint covariance is the addition, and it
    is what makes ``.contrast`` and the total effect honest: on the test
    design the total's standard error is 0.032, against 0.062 from adding
    the per-period variances, because the period effects are negatively
    correlated. ``diagnostics['independent_sum_se']`` reports the wrong
    number alongside the right one so the gap is visible.

    Effects are identified only under sequential ignorability: given the
    recorded state, this period's treatment is as good as random. No test
    can confirm that; what the function can do is stop you from omitting
    the treatment history, which is the part people forget.

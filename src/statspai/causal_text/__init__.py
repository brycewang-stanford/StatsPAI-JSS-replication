"""Causal inference with text data — MVP (P1-B, v1.6 experimental).

Two methods to start the family:

* :func:`text_treatment_effect` — Veitch-Wang-Blei (2020) text-as-
  treatment via embedding adjustment.  Estimates the ATE of a
  user-supplied treatment indicator while controlling for the
  confounding variation captured in the text embedding.

* :func:`llm_annotator_correct` — Egami-Hinck-Stewart-Wei (2024)
  measurement-error correction for LLM-derived treatment labels.
  Given a small validation subset where both LLM and human labels
  exist, debias the downstream regression coefficient via Hausman-
  style correction.

Status
------
**Experimental.**  Both estimators ship with conservative defaults and
validation-set-estimated noise parameters; consume them as a starting
point, not a final answer.  Future versions will add text-as-confounder
(Roberts-Stewart-Nielsen) and text-as-outcome (Egami et al. 2018)
methods alongside topic-model integration.

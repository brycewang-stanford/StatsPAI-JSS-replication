"""
Entropy Balancing (Hainmueller 2012).

Reweights the control group so that weighted covariate moments (mean,
variance, skewness) exactly match the treated group, without dropping
observations or relying on propensity score models.

More robust than PSM because it directly targets balance rather than
modeling the selection process.

    Entropy Balancing treatment effect estimator.

    Reweights control units to exactly match treated covariate moments,
    then estimates ATT via weighted difference in means.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : pd.DataFrame
    y : str
        Outcome variable.
    treat : str
        Binary treatment indicator (0/1).
    covariates : list of str
        Covariates to balance on.
    moments : int, default 1
        Number of moments to balance:
        - 1: means only
        - 2: means and variances
        - 3: means, variances, and skewness
    alpha : float, default 0.05
    vce : {'mestimation', 'naive'}, default 'mestimation'
        Standard error of the ATT.

        - ``'mestimation'``: the sandwich variance of the stacked
          estimating equations -- treated moment means, the entropy-balancing
          dual conditions, and the two outcome means -- so the uncertainty
          from estimating the weights is propagated. This is the variance
          R ``WeightIt::lm_weightit(..., vcov = "asympt")`` reports for
          ``method = "ebal", estimand = "ATT"``, and it agrees with it to
          ~1e-9 (``tests/reference_parity/test_ebalance_weightit_parity.py``).
          Because the weights balance the covariates exactly, outcome
          variation that the covariates explain cancels out of the ATT, and
          this variance reflects that.
        - ``'naive'``: the pre-1.31 formula, a weighted two-sample variance
          that treats the weights as fixed. It ignores the balancing, so it
          overstates the standard error whenever the covariates predict the
          outcome (by about 2x on the Track B design: coverage 1.000, size
          0.000). Retained only to reproduce earlier numbers.

    Notes
    -----
    Entropy balancing solves:

    .. math::
        \\min_w \\sum_i w_i \\log(w_i / q_i)

    subject to balance constraints (weighted moments match) and
    normalization (weights sum to 1).

    Unlike PSM, this guarantees exact balance on specified moments
    without iteration or caliper tuning.

    If the dual optimizer raises, uniform control weights are used as a
    fallback; a ``ConvergenceWarning`` is emitted and
    ``model_info['weights_fallback']`` is set to True.

    Entropy balancing's defining property is that the reweighted moments
    match the targets *exactly*, so the solver must be driven to a true
    stationary point rather than merely to a good objective value.

    Writing ``A_i = C_i - targets``, the weights are

        F(λ) = log Σ_i q_i exp(-A_i'λ)

    Exact balance is precisely ``∇F = 0``, so Newton's method with a
    backtracking line search is run until ``‖A'w‖_∞`` is at tolerance.

    The constraint columns are additionally divided by their standard
    deviation before solving. Without that rescaling the dual Hessian is
    badly conditioned whenever covariates live on different scales (a
    dollar-denominated earnings variable next to a 0/1 indicator), and a

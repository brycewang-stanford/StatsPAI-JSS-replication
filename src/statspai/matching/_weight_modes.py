"""Stata weight-regime semantics for matched-sample regressions.

Stata's ``regress`` accepts several weight kinds that share a point estimate
but *not* a variance.  Matched-sample work only ever needs two of them, and
the difference between them is a standing source of confusion when a PSM-DID
is ported from Stata:

``aweight`` (analytic weights)
    "This row is a mean of ``w`` underlying observations."  The estimator is
    WLS; the residual degrees of freedom stay at ``n_rows - k``.  Stata
    rescales the weights to sum to ``n_rows``, which leaves
    ``sigma2 * (X'WX)^-1`` unchanged — the reported variance is invariant to
    the scale of ``w``.

``fweight`` (frequency weights)
    "This row *stands for* ``w`` identical rows."  The residual degrees of
    freedom become ``sum(w) - k`` and every ``N``-dependent correction (the
    ``(N-1)/(N-k)`` factor in the cluster sandwich included) uses ``sum(w)``
    rather than the row count.  Stata therefore rejects non-integer ``w``.

Because ``fweight`` *is defined as* row replication, the honest way to
implement it is to replicate the rows and run the unweighted regression.
That is what :func:`expand_frequency_weights` does, and it is not an
approximation: verified against Stata 18 MP on the fixture behind
``tests/reference_parity/test_psmdid_weight_parity.py``, physically expanding
the matched sample and running ``reg y d post did`` reproduces
``reg y d post did [fweight=_weight]`` bit-for-bit — coefficient
``1.55116250172257e+00``, SE ``2.14796919061755e-01``, ``df_r = 496`` — and
likewise under ``cluster(id)`` (SE ``1.08275840314657e-01``, ``df_r = 184``,
``G = 185``).  Deriving Stata's per-VCE degrees-of-freedom corrections by
hand would be both more code and more ways to be wrong.

The cost is memory: the expanded frame has ``sum(w)`` rows.  For a matched
PSM sample ``sum(w)`` is on the order of twice the number of treated units
per period, so this is cheap in the setting it exists for.

    This is the *definition* of a frequency weight, so the unweighted
    regression on the returned frame is exactly the ``[fweight=]``
    regression on the input — coefficients, ``sigma2``, residual degrees of
    freedom, t / p values, and the clustered sandwich alike.  Replicated rows
    keep their original cluster label, so the number of clusters is
    unchanged; only ``N`` grows.

    Parameters
    ----------
    frame : DataFrame
        Rows to expand.  The index is not preserved (replication makes it
        non-unique by construction); the result is re-indexed 0..N-1.
    weight_col : str
        Column holding the frequency weights.  Must be positive and integral.

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
        The expanded frame, with ``weight_col`` left in place (every row now

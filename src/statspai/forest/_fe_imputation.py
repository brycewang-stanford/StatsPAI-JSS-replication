"""Imputation-score inference for causal forests with fixed effects.

A forest fitted with ``fe="unit"`` / ``fe="twoway"`` predicts ``tau(x)`` but
has no doubly-robust score: the AIPW correction needs a propensity
``E[D | X]``, which a within-unit design does not define.  This module
supplies the missing unbiased signal from the same model the forest
assumes,

    Y_it = alpha_i + gamma_t + tau(X_it) D_it + e_it,

by *imputation* [borusyak2024revisiting]: the unit and period effects are
fitted on the untreated cells only, and every treated cell gets

    Gamma_it = Y_it - (alpha_hat_i + gamma_hat_t),

an estimate of its own effect that is unbiased under parallel trends and
no anticipation whatever the heterogeneity -- in ``x``, in calendar time or
in exposure.  The forest then plays the role of a proxy, as in the generic
machine-learning inference of [chernozhukov2025generic]:

* the average effect on the treated is the mean of ``Gamma`` (it is the
  imputation estimator of the ATT, so it inherits the robustness of that
  estimator to staggered adoption with dynamic effects);
* a group average (a country pair, a country, a period, a quantile of the
  forest's prediction) is the mean of ``Gamma`` over the group's treated
  cells;
* the best linear projection regresses ``Gamma`` on covariates, and the
  calibration regression regresses it on the out-of-bag forest prediction,
  which gives a heterogeneity test *and* a slope that does correct the
  forest's shrinkage.

Every such quantity is linear in the outcome, ``theta = v' y``; the weights
``v`` are the target weights on treated cells minus their least-squares
projection through the untreated design (the construction of
``did._bjs_variance``).  Variances are sums of cluster (or dyadic) score
sums of ``v * eps``.  Untreated cells use their ``Y(0)`` residual; treated
cells use ``Gamma`` minus a heterogeneity model, either the
``v^2``-weighted cohort-by-relative-time mean of the Borusyak--Jaravel--
Spiess convention (``variance="bjs"``, conservative) or the out-of-bag
forest prediction followed by the same block centring
(``variance="forest"``).  The forest prediction for a unit never uses that
unit's data (trees draw whole units), so it can model the heterogeneity
without absorbing the unit's own noise.

Dyadic data (country pairs) can use the dyadic-robust variance of
[aronow2015cluster]: any two rows that share a member are allowed to be
correlated.

    r"""RATE of a fixed-effects forest, on the treated cells it identifies.

    The doubly-robust score behind :func:`statspai.rate` needs a propensity,
    which a within-unit design does not have; the imputation score
    :math:`\Gamma_{it} = Y_{it} - \hat\alpha_i - \hat\gamma_t` does the same
    job on treated cells, so the whole curve is read on that population:

    .. math::
        \mathrm{TOC}(q) = \mathrm{ATT}\bigl(\text{top } q
        \text{ by } S\bigr) - \mathrm{ATT},

    "how much larger is the effect among the cells this rule would have
    prioritised". Effects on untreated cells are not identified, so this is
    a retrospective targeting curve, not the population RATE that a
    randomised design gives.

    ``se_method="imputation"`` (default) composes the two linear maps --
    the rank weights of :func:`statspai.forest.forest_inference.
    rate_rank_weights` and the imputation weights of
    :func:`functional_weights` -- so the RATE is one more linear functional
    of ``y``, with the same exact, cluster- (or dyad-) robust variance as
    the ATT.  It conditions on the prioritisation, which is what you want
    when ``priorities`` were fitted elsewhere.  ``se_method="influence"``
    instead treats the imputation scores as data and applies the
    rank-corrected influence function of :func:`statspai.rate`: it carries
    the cost of estimating the ranking but not of estimating the fixed
    effects.  See :func:`statspai.rate` for which to report.

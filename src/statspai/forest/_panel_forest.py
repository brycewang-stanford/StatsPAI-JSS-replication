"""Causal forest with fixed effects (panel data).

``CausalForest(fe="unit" | "twoway")`` estimates heterogeneous effects in

    Y_it = alpha_i + gamma_t + tau(X_it) D_it + e_it

without letting the fixed effects masquerade as heterogeneity.  A pooled
forest (or one run on globally demeaned data) splits on covariates that are
correlated with ``alpha_i`` and reports level differences as effect
differences; and global two-way demeaning of ``tau(X_i) D_it`` mixes the
effects of different units, so the residualized regression is misspecified
whenever ``tau`` varies.  Removing the fixed effects *within each node* --
where units are similar in ``X`` and ``tau`` is close to constant -- avoids
both problems (Kattenberg, Scheer and Thiel 2023, Sec. 3).

Implementation choices (all documented, none copied from other code):

* Splitting uses the GRF gradient criterion on the node-residualized
  outcome and treatment, with the residualized treatment as the instrument
  of the stabilised splitting rule.
* Leaves are residualized again on their honest estimation sample and
  store the within moments ``sum Y~ D~`` and ``sum D~^2``; predictions are
  the ratio of their tree averages, so the GRF prediction and little-bag
  variance apply unchanged.  A leaf whose residualized treatment has no
  variation is treated as uninformative (excluded), never as a zero effect.
* The two-way within transformation iterates alternating projections to a
  tolerance, so unbalanced nodes are exact up to ``1e-10`` rather than an
  arbitrary fixed number of sweeps.
* Trees are sampled, split into honest halves and cross-fitted by unit
  (or by a coarser cluster that nests units).
* ``Y`` and ``D`` are first centred by out-of-bag regression forests on
  the covariates, as in the authors' implementation; for time-invariant
  covariates this centring is absorbed by the unit effect.

The identifying assumption is conditional parallel trends with no
anticipation; staggered adoption with heterogeneous dynamic effects should
use :func:`statspai.did_forest`, which builds clean group-time comparisons.

"""Heterogeneity analysis after a causal forest: groups, support, pre-trends.

Three questions come after the forest has produced ``tau(x)``, and each
needs its own inference rather than a summary of the fitted predictions:

* :func:`forest_group_effects` -- how large is the effect for a country
  pair, a country, a period, or a quantile of the forest's prediction?
  Averages of unbiased scores with valid standard errors (imputation scores
  for forests with fixed effects, AIPW scores otherwise), including
  membership groups for dyadic data and a dyadic-robust variance.
* :func:`forest_support` -- is a counterfactual prediction for a unit that
  was never treated an interpolation or an extrapolation?
* :func:`cate_pretrend_test` -- were the units the forest ranks as high-
  effect already on a different trajectory before treatment?

The worked example in ``docs/guides/heterogeneity_panel_forests.md``
reproduces the workflow of [aytug2026euro] (causal forests with fixed
effects [kattenberg2023causal] on a dyadic trade panel) on simulated data.

    """Average treatment effects by group, with valid standard errors.

    A causal forest's predictions are regularised: averaging them over a
    group gives a number that is shrunk toward the overall mean and whose
    spread says nothing about sampling error.  This function averages an
    *unbiased* per-row signal instead and uses the forest only to form
    groups when asked to:

    * **Forests with two-way fixed effects** (``fe="twoway"``): the
      imputation score ``Y - alpha_hat_i - gamma_hat_t`` of each treated
      cell, with unit and period effects fitted on the untreated cells
      [borusyak2024revisiting].  Each group estimate is the ATT over the
      group's treated cells.  Standard errors use the exact linear weights
      of the imputation estimator; treated residuals are centred on the
      out-of-bag forest prediction and then on cohort x event-time means
      (``variance="forest"``) or on those means only (``variance="bjs"``,
      the conservative convention of :func:`statspai.did_imputation`).
    * **Pooled forests**: the AIPW score of every row; each estimate is the
      group ATE.

    Rows are weighted by the forest's observation weights, so with
    ``equalize_cluster_weights=True`` every cluster gets equal weight in each
    group average (a different estimand from :func:`statspai.did_imputation`,
    which weights treated cells equally).

    Parameters
    ----------
    forest : CausalForest
        Fitted with the GRF engine.
    by : None, "cate_quantile" or array-like
        ``None`` pools all eligible rows (or, with ``members``, forms one
        group per member).  ``"cate_quantile"`` bins eligible rows into
        ``n_groups`` quantiles of the out-of-bag forest prediction (sorted
        group average treatment effects, [chernozhukov2025generic]).  An
        array gives one label per training row (a pair id, a period band,
        ``df["year"] >= 2009`` ...).
    members : (n, 2) array-like, optional
        The two members of each row of dyadic data (exporter and importer,
        the two countries of a pair).  With ``by=None`` each member is a
        group and a row counts for both of its members -- the average
        effect over all pairs a country belongs to.
    n_groups : int, default 4
        Number of quantile groups for ``by="cate_quantile"``.
    cluster : None, "dyadic" or array-like
        ``None`` clusters by the forest's clusters (default: the panel
        unit).  ``"dyadic"`` (requires ``members``) allows any two rows
        that share a member to be correlated [aronow2015cluster].  An array
        gives other cluster ids.
    variance : {"forest", "bjs"}, default "forest"
        Forests with fixed effects only; see above.
    alpha : float, default 0.05
    scale : {"level", "percent"}, default "level"
        ``"percent"`` adds ``100 * (exp(x) - 1)`` columns for log outcomes
        (interval endpoints are transformed, not re-derived).
    min_rows : int, default 1
        Drop groups with fewer eligible rows.
    covariates : "none", "auto", list of str or array, default "none"
        Forests with fixed effects only: covariates entering the untreated
        outcome model linearly, ``Y(0) = alpha_i + gamma_t + C' beta``.
        ``"none"`` is the pure two-way model of
        :func:`statspai.did_imputation`; ``"auto"`` adds the forest's effect
        modifiers and covariates that vary within units (time-invariant ones
        are absorbed by the unit effect).  Controls must not be affected by
        the treatment.

    Returns
    -------
    pandas.DataFrame
        One row per group: ``n_rows``, ``n_units``, ``estimate``, ``se``,
        ``z``, ``p``, ``ci_low``, ``ci_high`` and ``forest_mean`` (the mean
        out-of-bag prediction over the same rows, for comparison).
        ``attrs`` holds ``method``, ``estimand``, the full ``vcov`` and
        ``tests``: a Wald test that all group effects are equal and the
        last-minus-first difference with its standard error.

    Examples
    --------

    >>> df = sp.datasets.currency_union_panel(seed=0)
    >>> cf = sp.causal_forest(
    ...     data=df, y="log_trade", d="euro",

    Heterogeneity found by a forest can be spurious if the units it ranks

    test sorts units into ``n_groups`` quantiles of their mean out-of-bag
    prediction (or uses ``groups``) and, on the **untreated** cells only,
    regresses the outcome on unit and period effects and on lead indicators
    ``1[t - g = k] x 1[group]`` for ``k = -1, ..., -leads`` -- the
    pre-trend regression of [borusyak2024revisiting], interacted with the
    groups.  Periods earlier than ``-leads`` and never-treated units are the
    reference.  Using untreated cells only keeps post-treatment effect
    heterogeneity out of the test.

    Two Wald tests are reported: all leads are zero, and the leads are
    equal across groups (for each ``k``, every group's lead equals the
    first group's).  The second is the test that bears on heterogeneity.
    Standard errors are clustered by the forest's clusters with the CR1
    factor ``G/(G-1) (n-1)/(n-K)``, where ``K`` counts the leads and the
    period effects (unit effects are nested in unit clusters, fixest's

    Parameters
    ----------
    forest : CausalForest
        Fitted with ``fe="twoway"`` and a binary absorbing treatment.
    n_groups : int, default 2
        Quantile groups of the unit-level mean OOB prediction.
    leads : int, optional
        Number of pre-treatment leads (default: ``min(4, L - 1)`` where
        ``L`` is the longest pre-treatment spell; with ``L`` leads every
        pre-period of the earliest-observed units is a lead and the leads
        are collinear with their unit effects).
    groups : array-like, optional
        One label per training row, constant within units; overrides
        ``n_groups``.
    time_effects : {"common", "by_group"}, default "common"
        ``"common"`` matches the forest and the imputation scores, which
        use one set of period effects; ``"by_group"`` gives each group its
        own period effects (separate event studies per group).
    alpha : float, default 0.05
    covariates : "none", "auto", list of str or array, default "none"
        Time-varying covariates added linearly, as in the imputation model
        of :func:`forest_group_effects`.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        ``coefficients`` (DataFrame indexed by group and lead), ``joint_zero``
        and ``equal_across_groups`` (``stat``, ``df``, ``p``), ``group_of_unit``

    r"""RATE of the forest's targeting rule, fitted and evaluated on disjoint units.

    :func:`statspai.rate` ranks the rows it also scores. For a forest with
    fixed effects that is not a valid test even though the predictions are
    out-of-bag: every imputation score carries :math:`-\hat\gamma_t`,
    estimated from the same periods the forest was trained on, so the
    ranking and the scores stay correlated. Measured on a design with **no
    heterogeneity whatsoever** (200 replications, N = 150 units, T = 8,
    staggered adoption selected on the unit effect, ``tau = 0.3``): AUTOC
    averaged **-0.025** instead of 0 and a nominal 5% test rejected
    **17.5%** of the time; QINI averaged -0.006 and rejected 13.5%.

    This function removes the overlap. The units (or, with ``members=``, the
    nodes of a dyadic panel) are split in two; a forest with the same
    hyper-parameters is refitted on each half; the training half's forest
    ranks the evaluation half's treated cells, whose imputation scores come
    from an untreated two-way model fitted on the evaluation half alone.
    Nothing the rule saw enters the score it is graded on. On the same null
    design AUTOC then averaged **+0.0008** and rejected **7.5%** of the time
    (QINI +0.0004 and 4.0%); against ``tau = 0.3 + 0.5 z`` it kept 99.5% and
    100% power. ``variance='forest'`` rejected 5.0% and 4.0% under the null
    but understates the spread under the alternative (mean standard error
    0.060 against a Monte Carlo 0.083), which is why ``'bjs'`` is the
    default here.

    The price is sample: each forest sees half the units, so the rule is
    noisier than the one fitted on everything and the RATE it earns is a
    *lower bound* on what the full-sample rule is worth. Report
    :func:`statspai.rate` for the point estimate of the full rule if you
    like, but report this one when the claim is that targeting pays.

    Parameters
    ----------
    forest : fitted CausalForest
        Supplies the data and the hyper-parameters; it is not itself used to
        rank or to score, and is left untouched.
    target : {'AUTOC', 'QINI'}
    train_frac : float
        Share of units (members) that fit the rule. The rest evaluate it.
    random_state : int
        Seed for the split. The refitted forests keep the original's seed.
    members : array-like, optional
        The two members of each dyadic row. Splitting is then by member and
        rows that straddle the two halves are dropped (counted in the
        result), because a flow between a training and an evaluation country
        belongs to neither.
    alpha, variance, cluster, covariates, se_method, q_grid
        Passed to :func:`statspai.rate` on the evaluation half.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        As :func:`statspai.rate`, plus ``n_train_units`` / ``n_eval_units``,
        ``n_rows_dropped``, ``split_by`` and ``split_random_state``.

    See Also
    --------
    statspai.rate : the same curve without the split (a diagnostic).
    statspai.forest_group_effects : effects for named groups rather than a curve.

    **Many splits, not one.** A single split is a draw, not an estimator:
    on the guide's 15-country trade panel six of them ranged over +/-0.08,
    and with ``random_state`` in reach it is easy to keep the one that
    agrees with you -- the practice [chernozhukov2025generic] show
    invalidates inference. Their variational estimation and inference
    (VEIN) is what ``n_splits`` does: the estimate is the median over
    splits, the interval is the median of the conditional intervals built
    at ``1 - alpha / 2`` (whose median covers at ``1 - alpha``), and the
    p-value is twice the median conditional p-value. ``n_splits=21`` costs
    about twelve seconds on a 150-unit panel; 100, as they use, costs about
    a minute. ``n_splits=1`` reproduces a single conditional split and
    warns. ``estimate_min`` / ``estimate_max`` / ``estimate_iqr`` in the
    result show how much the split was moving the answer.

    Parameters
    ----------
    forest, target, train_frac, members, alpha, variance, cluster,
    covariates, se_method, q_grid
        As described above.
    n_splits : int, default 21
        Splits to aggregate by VEIN. Odd, so the median is an order
        statistic.
    random_state : int, default 0
        Seeds the *sequence* of splits; split ``b`` uses
        ``random_state + b``.

    ``V(pi) = mean over treated cells of (tau - cost) * pi``. Both that and
    the gain over treating every cell, ``V(pi) - V(1)``, are linear in
    ``y`` once ``pi`` is fixed, so each gets the exact, cluster- or
    dyad-robust variance the ATT gets, from one design and one call.

    The gain's *estimate* is exactly the difference of the other two. Its
    *standard error* is not the difference of their variances, and should
    not be: the BJS centring subtracts a cohort x event-time mean weighted
    by that functional's own ``v^2``, so the gain -- whose weights vanish
    on every cell the rule treats -- is centred on the withheld cells
    alone. Measured against the true value of the fitted rule, at two
    operating points, 150 replications each:

    ========================  ==========  =============  ==============
    share of cells treated    MC error    dedicated      ``c'Vc``
    ========================  ==========  =============  ==============

    ========================  ==========  =============  ==============

    The dedicated column is exact where the rule withholds little and
    conservative where it withholds a lot; it never undercovered, and the
    worry that centring on few withheld cells would deflate it did not
    materialise. It is what ``gain_over_treat_all['se']`` reports.
    ``diagnostics['gain_se_contrast']`` carries the ``c'Vc`` reading, so a
    caller who rebuilds it from ``vcov`` can see why the two differ instead
    of finding a discrepancy.

    r"""A treatment rule for a fixed-effects forest, and what it was worth.

    Policy learning [athey2021policy] maximises
    :math:`V(\pi) = E[\Gamma_i \pi(X_i)]` over a class of rules, with
    :math:`\Gamma` a score unbiased for the individual effect. A
    within-unit design has no propensity, so the doubly-robust score
    :func:`statspai.policy_tree` uses does not exist; the imputation scores
    that give the ATT do, and the rule is learned on those.

    **Read the population it applies to.** Those scores live on treated
    cells, so this is a *retrospective* rule: "of the cells that were
    treated, which should have been". It does not say whether an untreated
    unit should be treated -- that is an extrapolation of ``tau(x)``, which
    :func:`statspai.average_treatment_effect` also refuses for these
    forests. Check :func:`statspai.forest_support` before carrying the rule
    to units the design never switched.

    With ``cost=0`` and effects that are positive everywhere, treating
    every cell is optimal and the tree has nothing to find. ``cost`` is
    what usually makes targeting a real question: the rule then treats
    where ``tau > cost``.

    **The rule is fitted and priced on disjoint units.** A tree chosen to
    maximise the value of the very scores it is then priced against is
    priced on its own noise. Measured on a design where *every rule is
    worth exactly the same* -- no heterogeneity, and ``cost`` equal to the
    constant effect, so the true gain over treating everyone is exactly 0
    (200 replications, N = 200 units, T = 8) -- the same-sample gain
    averaged **+0.048**, larger than its own standard error of 0.037, and
    **13.0%** of runs reported a significant benefit from targeting where
    none existed. Fitted and priced on disjoint halves: **+0.005** and
    **3.5%**. The split costs almost nothing when the heterogeneity is
    real: with ``tau = 0.3 + 0.8 z`` and ``cost = 0.3`` the oracle gain is
    ``0.8 * phi(0) = 0.3191``, and the split-sample estimate averaged
    **0.3189** at 99.5% power, against a same-sample **0.3316** that
    overshoots by 0.012. The split is therefore not optional here;
    ``train_frac`` moves it, nothing switches it off.

    Parameters
    ----------
    forest : fitted CausalForest with ``fe="twoway"``
        Supplies the data and the hyper-parameters; it is not itself used
        to fit or to price the rule, and is left untouched.
    depth : int, default 2
        Tree depth. ``<= 2`` is searched exactly (the ``policytree``
        guarantee), deeper is greedy and says so in ``method``.
    cost : float, default 0
        Cost of treating one cell, in the outcome's units. The rule treats
        where the effect exceeds it.
    x : list of str or array, optional
        Policy covariates. Defaults to the forest's effect modifiers.
        Keep this list short and interpretable -- it is the rule a
        programme would actually be written in.
    min_leaf_size : int, optional
        Smallest leaf; default ``max(10, 5% of the evaluation cells)``.
    train_frac : float, default 0.5
        Share of units (or, with ``members=``, dyadic nodes) that fit the
        rule. The rest price it.
    random_state : int, default 0
    members : array-like, optional
        The two members of each dyadic row; splitting is then by member.
    alpha, variance, cluster, covariates
        As :func:`statspai.forest_group_effects`. ``variance`` defaults to
        ``'bjs'`` here for the reason it does in :func:`statspai.rate`.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        ``rules`` (the tree, printable), ``tree`` (nested dict),
        ``policy`` (0/1 per evaluation cell), ``value`` and
        ``value_treat_all`` and ``gain_over_treat_all`` (each with
        ``estimate``, ``se``, ``ci_low``, ``ci_high``, ``p``),
        ``share_treated``, ``n_train_units`` / ``n_eval_units``,
        ``split_by``, ``method``, ``diagnostics``.

    See Also
    --------
    statspai.policy_tree : the doubly-robust version, for designs with a
        propensity.
    statspai.rate_split : is *any* ranking worth targeting on?
    statspai.forest_support : is a rule safe to carry to untreated units?

    **Many splits, not one.** One split is a draw: it fixes both the rule
    and its price, and with ``random_state`` in reach it is easy to keep
    the pair that agrees with you -- the practice
    [chernozhukov2025generic] show invalidates inference. ``n_splits``
    aggregates by their variational estimation and inference (VEIN): the
    value, the treat-all value and the gain are each the median over
    splits, their intervals are medians of conditional intervals built at
    ``1 - alpha / 2`` (whose median covers at ``1 - alpha``), and the
    p-values are twice the median conditional p-value. Each is aggregated
    on its own, as [chernozhukov2025generic] do, so with ``n_splits > 1``
    the three medians **do not** satisfy
    ``gain = value - value_treat_all`` -- a median of differences is not a
    difference of medians. That identity holds within each split, and
    ``n_splits=1`` reports it directly. A *rule* cannot be
    averaged either, so the one reported is the rule from the split whose
    gain is the median, and ``diagnostics['split_stability']`` says how often each
    covariate was chosen at the root and how far the thresholds and treated
    shares moved -- if the root covariate changes from split to split, the
    rule is not identified by this sample however tight the interval on its
    value looks. ``n_splits=21`` costs about twelve seconds on a 150-unit
    panel; ``n_splits=1`` reproduces one conditional split and warns.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_splits : int, default 21
        Splits to aggregate by VEIN. Odd, so the median is an order
        statistic.
    random_state : int, default 0
        Seeds the *sequence* of splits; split ``b`` uses
        ``random_state + b``.

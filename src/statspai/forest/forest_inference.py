"""
GRF-style inference add-ons for the StatsPAI CausalForest.

Implements:

- :func:`calibration_test` (alias ``test_calibration``): the best linear
  predictor calibration test of CATE predictions [@chernozhukov2025generic],
  in the form of ``grf::test_calibration``.  Under correct average
  calibration the "mean forest prediction" coefficient is 1; under real
  heterogeneity the "differential forest prediction" coefficient is > 0.
- :func:`calibrate_cate`: CATE predictions rescaled by that calibration.
- :func:`rate`: rank-weighted average treatment effect (AUTOC / QINI)
  [@yadlowsky2025evaluating], ``grf::rank_average_treatment_effect``.
- :func:`honest_variance`: deprecated; see its docstring.
- :func:`average_treatment_effect`: GRF-style ATE/ATT/ATC/ATO aggregation
  of CATE predictions with effective sample size and normal CIs.
- :func:`forest_diagnostics`: overlap and CATE-distribution diagnostics.

Two layers
----------
The public functions above take a fitted :class:`CausalForest` object
(plus, for some, outcome / treatment / feature arrays), never mutate it,
and decide *which* forest outputs to use: out-of-bag CATE predictions,
observation weights and clusters for forests fitted with the GRF engine,
and the training rows only.

Underneath them sits a layer of pure *post-fit operators* -- deterministic
maps from forest outputs (``tau_hat``, the cross-fitted nuisances
``Y_hat = E[Y|X]`` and ``W_hat = E[W|X]``) and the data to a reported
number: :func:`grf_calibration`, :func:`rate_from_scores`,
:func:`aipw_scores`, :func:`grf_att_atc` and :func:`grf_overlap_ate`.  The
forest itself is stochastic and not pinnable across implementations; the
operators are, and each one is pinned to ``grf`` 2.6.1 fed the same forest
outputs (``tests/reference_parity/test_ml_causal_R_parity.py``,
``test_grf_aipw_operator_parity.py``, ``test_grf_cluster_operator_parity.py``).

    t with ``n - 2`` degrees of freedom -- ``grf``'s reporting rule

    """Best-linear-predictor calibration test of CATEs [@chernozhukov2025generic].

    The form of ``grf::test_calibration``: the outcome residual
    ``Y - Y_hat`` is regressed (no intercept) on the treatment residual
    scaled by the mean forest prediction and on the treatment residual
    times the demeaned prediction,

        Y - Y_hat = b1 (W - W_hat) mean(tau_hat)
                    + b2 (W - W_hat) (tau_hat - mean(tau_hat)) + e.

    ``b1 = 1`` indicates a calibrated mean prediction; ``b2 = 1`` a
    calibrated heterogeneity signal, and a significantly positive ``b2``
    is evidence of heterogeneity -- the headline finding, showing the
    forest captures *real* heterogeneity rather than noise.  Following
    ``grf``, ``t`` tests each coefficient against 0 and ``p`` is
    **one-sided** (alternative > 0) from Student's t with ``n - 2``
    degrees of freedom; the default ``vce='HC3'`` is ``grf``'s.
    ``beta_differential`` is also the slope by which the predictions
    should be rescaled around their mean (see :func:`calibrate_cate`).

    For forests fitted with the GRF engine (the default) ``tau_hat`` is the
    **out-of-bag** prediction, the regression uses the forest's observation
    weights and a cluster-robust covariance when the forest has clusters,
    and the test is defined on the training sample, so ``X`` / ``Y`` / ``T``
    may be omitted (the stored arrays are used) and, if given, must equal
    them.  The regression itself is the pure operator
    :func:`grf_calibration`.

    Forests with two-way fixed effects (``fe='twoway'``) and a binary
    treatment use ``method='imputation'`` by default: the imputation score
    ``Y - alpha_hat_i - gamma_hat_t`` of each treated cell (unit and period
    effects fitted on untreated cells, [borusyak2024revisiting]) is
    regressed on ``mean(tau_oob)`` and ``tau_oob - mean(tau_oob)`` over the
    treated cells.  The score is unbiased for each cell's effect, so
    ``beta_differential`` is the best-linear-predictor slope of the true
    effect on the forest prediction (it corrects the forest's shrinkage)
    and the one-sided test of it is a heterogeneity test.  Standard errors
    use the exact linear weights of the imputation estimator, clustered by
    the forest's clusters, with a normal reference; ``vce`` does not apply.
    ``method='within'`` keeps the earlier regression on globally
    within-transformed variables [aytug2026attenuated], which tests for
    heterogeneity but whose slope is not a de-attenuation factor.

    .. versionchanged:: 1.30.0
       ``method=`` / ``covariates=`` added; forests with two-way fixed
       effects and a binary treatment default to the imputation regression.
       ``t`` / ``p`` are ``grf``'s: each coefficient against 0, one-sided,
       Student t (the ``null`` column is gone; ``t_vs_zero`` /
       ``p_one_sided`` are kept as synonyms).  Legacy-engine forests use
       ``grf``'s regression too: earlier releases regressed an
       inverse-propensity pseudo-outcome on ``[tau_hat, tau_hat -
       mean(tau_hat)]``, so ``differential_forest_prediction`` estimated
       ``b2 - b1`` rather than ``b2``, and paired rows other than the
       training sample with mean-of-Y / mean-of-T stand-in nuisances.

    Parameters
    ----------
    forest : fitted CausalForest
    X, Y, T : optional arrays
        The training sample (defaults to the stored arrays).
    alpha : float
        Level for ``ci_low`` / ``ci_high``.
    vce : {'HC3', 'HC2', 'HC1', 'HC0'}
        Heteroskedasticity-robust covariance (``grf``'s ``vcov.type``).
    method : {'auto', 'imputation', 'within'}, default 'auto'
        Forests with fixed effects only: ``'auto'`` is ``'imputation'`` for
        ``fe='twoway'`` with a binary treatment and ``'within'`` otherwise.
        Other forests accept only ``'auto'``.
    covariates : 'none', 'auto', list of str or array, default 'none'
        Covariates in the untreated outcome model of the imputation
        regression (see :func:`average_treatment_effect`).

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
        Rows ``mean_forest_prediction`` and ``differential_forest_prediction``
        with ``coef``, ``se``, ``t``, ``p``, ``ci_low``, ``ci_high``,
        ``t_vs_zero``, ``p_one_sided``.

    ``grf::rank_average_treatment_effect``: evaluates a prioritisation

    GRF-engine forests), or any ``priorities`` vector (e.g. from a model
    trained on another sample) -- on the forest's doubly-robust scores
    (:func:`aipw_scores`, ``grf::get_scores``).  Units are sorted by
    decreasing priority, scores are averaged within tied priorities, and

    - **AUTOC** = mean over ``k`` of ``TOC_k``,
    - **QINI** = mean over ``k`` of ``(k/n) TOC_k``,

    with ``TOC_k`` the mean score of the top ``k`` units minus the overall
    mean -- ``grf``'s estimator, reproduced exactly given the same scores
    and priorities (the pure operator :func:`rate_from_scores`).

    Standard error: ``se_method='influence'`` (default) is the analytic
    influence-function SE including the term from estimating the priority
    ranks, summed within clusters when the forest has clusters;
    ``se_method='half_sample'`` is ``grf``'s half-sample bootstrap with
    ``n_bootstrap`` draws (``R`` in ``grf``, default 200; whole clusters
    are drawn), seeded by ``seed``.  The two agree to Monte Carlo error.

    Because priorities and evaluation share one sample when
    ``priorities`` is omitted, RATE is then a *diagnostic*; for a
    pre-registered test of targeting value, fit the forest on a training
    split and evaluate priorities on a held-out split.

    **Forests with fixed effects** have no propensity, so the curve is read
    on the population they identify -- the treated cells -- through the
    imputation scores :math:`\Gamma_{it} = Y_{it} - \hat\alpha_i -
    \hat\gamma_t` that :func:`statspai.average_treatment_effect` already
    uses there:  ``TOC(q) = ATT(top q by priority) - ATT``, a
    *retrospective* targeting curve ("the effect was this much larger among
    the cells the rule would have prioritised"), not the population RATE a
    randomised design gives.  ``variance=``, ``cluster=``, ``members=`` and
    ``covariates=`` are then passed through exactly as in
    :func:`statspai.forest_group_effects`, and ``se_method`` becomes:

    - ``'imputation'`` (what ``'auto'`` selects): the rank weights and the
      imputation weights are both linear, so their composition makes RATE
      one more linear functional of ``y`` with the same exact, cluster- or
      dyad-robust variance as the ATT.  The weights annihilate the fixed
      effects exactly (``max |Z'V| < 1e-15`` in the committed fixture) and
      sum to zero over treated cells, RATE being a contrast.
    - ``'influence'``: the rank-corrected influence function applied to the
      imputation scores -- it pays for estimating the ranking but treats
      the fixed effects as known.

    ``variance`` defaults to ``'bjs'`` here, not to the ``'forest'`` that
    :func:`statspai.average_treatment_effect` uses, and the reason is
    measured.  ``'forest'`` centres treated residuals on the out-of-bag
    prediction, which nets out the effect heterogeneity and so estimates
    the variance of the RATE *of this sample*; the ATT converges to its
    population value fast enough that this does not show, but RATE loads on
    the tail of the effect distribution and it does.  Over 120 replications
    (N = 150 units, T = 8, staggered adoption selected on the unit effect,
    tau = 0.3 + 0.5 z, priorities held out) nominal 95% intervals covered
    the *population* AUTOC 97.5% of the time with ``'bjs'`` and 90.8% with
    ``'forest'``; against the RATE of the realised sample it was the other
    way round, 99.2% and 95.8%.  So ``'bjs'`` is conservative for the
    population statement most readers want, ``'forest'`` is exact for the
    sample one.  Bias was -0.006 on 0.452 (AUTOC) and -0.0002 on 0.141
    (QINI).

    ``se_method='half_sample'`` raises for these forests: resampling units
    would have to refit the untreated two-way model in every draw, and the
    exact variance supersedes it.

    **Do not read the default ranking as a test.** With the forest's own
    out-of-bag predictions the ranking and the scores share
    ``gamma_hat_t``, so they stay correlated even though no unit predicts
    itself.  On the null design above (200 replications, no heterogeneity
    at all) AUTOC averaged -0.025 rather than 0 and a nominal 5% test
    rejected 17.5% of the time, QINI 13.5%.  :func:`statspai.rate_split`,
    which refits the rule on one half of the units and scores it on the
    other, averaged +0.0008 and rejected 7.5% and 4.0% with 99.5% and 100%
    power against ``tau = 0.3 + 0.5 z``.  A warning fires on this path;
    passing ``priorities=`` from a rule fitted elsewhere also silences it.

    .. versionchanged:: 1.31.0
       Forests with fixed effects are supported (they previously raised);
       the default ``se_method`` is ``'auto'``, which is ``'influence'`` for
       every forest that has a propensity, as before.

    .. versionchanged:: 1.30.0
       Scores are ``grf``'s (unclipped) AIPW scores; tied priorities are
       averaged as in ``grf``; QINI uses ``grf``'s ``k/n`` weights, so a
       flat TOC now gives exactly 0 (previously ``-mean(score) / (2n)``);
       the TOC curve interpolates between cut points as ``grf`` does; the
       influence-function SE includes the rank-estimation term
       (previously ~30% too large).

    Parameters
    ----------
    forest : fitted CausalForest
    X, Y, T : arrays, optional
        The training sample (defaults to the stored arrays).
    target : {'AUTOC', 'QINI'}
    q_grid : int
        Number of equally spaced points in ``(0, 1]`` at which the TOC
        curve is reported. Does not affect the estimate.
    alpha : float
    seed : int, optional
        Seed for ``se_method='half_sample'``.
    priorities : array, optional
        Priority score per training unit (higher = treat first). Defaults
        to the forest's CATE predictions.
    se_method : {'auto', 'influence', 'half_sample', 'imputation'}
        ``'auto'`` is ``'influence'``, or ``'imputation'`` for a forest with
        fixed effects. ``'imputation'`` is defined only for those.
    n_bootstrap : int
        Half-sample draws for ``se_method='half_sample'``.
    variance : {'bjs', 'forest'}
        Fixed-effects forests only: how treated residuals are centred
        before the cohort x event-time blocks. ``'bjs'`` (default here) is
        conservative for the population RATE, ``'forest'`` exact for the
        sample's -- see above.
    cluster : array-like or 'dyadic', optional
        Fixed-effects forests only; ``'dyadic'`` needs ``members=``.
    members : array-like, optional
        Fixed-effects forests only: the two members of each dyadic row.
    covariates : {'none', 'auto'}, list of str or array, default 'none'
        Fixed-effects forests only: time-varying covariates for the
        untreated model behind the imputation scores.

    Returns
    -------
    dict with keys ``estimate``, ``se``, ``ci_low``, ``ci_high``,
    ``target``, ``toc_curve`` (``(q_grid, 2)``), ``n``, ``method``,
    ``priority_source``, ``n_clusters``.

) -> Dict[str, float]:
    """Half-sample spread of the mean CATE prediction (deprecated).

    Draws ``n_splits`` random halves (without replacement) of the CATE
    predictions and reports the standard deviation of the half-sample
    means as ``se``. For a half-sample drawn without replacement the
    finite-population correction is exactly one half, so this spread
    estimates the sampling standard error of the full-sample mean,
    ``sd(tau_hat) / sqrt(n)``.

    It is **descriptive**: the predictions are held fixed, so the forest's
    own estimation error is not propagated. ``grf`` has no counterpart to
    this function.  For GRF-engine forests with ``X`` omitted it returns
    the doubly-robust ATE of :func:`average_treatment_effect` and its
    influence-function SE instead; use that function directly.

    .. versionchanged:: 1.30.0
       ``se`` was the standard deviation of the half-sample means divided
       by ``sqrt(n_splits)`` -- the Monte Carlo error of their average,
       which shrinks to zero as ``n_splits`` grows. It is now the spread
       itself.

    Parameters
    ----------
    forest : fitted CausalForest
    X : ndarray, optional
    n_splits : int
        Number of random half-sample draws.
    seed : int, optional

    This is the estimator's *operator*: the deterministic map from the

    nuisances :math:`\hat m(X) = \hat E[Y \mid X]` and
    :math:`\hat e(X) = \hat E[T \mid X]` -- to the influence-function
    scores whose sample mean is the point estimate and whose
    :math:`\mathrm{sd}/\sqrt n` is the standard error.

    Separating it out matters for verification. Two independently grown
    forests never share :math:`\hat\tau`, so an end-to-end comparison
    against ``grf`` can only be statistical: both engines are refitted
    under many seeds on fixed data and their seed distributions compared
    (``tests/reference_parity/test_grf_seed_mc_equivalence.py``). The
    operator, by contrast, is a closed form and is pinned
    *exactly* to ``grf::get_scores`` given the same forest outputs -- see
    ``tests/reference_parity/test_grf_aipw_operator_parity.py``.

    For ``target="all"`` this is the identity ``grf`` uses,

    .. math::
        \Gamma_i = \hat\tau(X_i)
            + \frac{T_i-\hat e(X_i)}{\hat e(X_i)(1-\hat e(X_i))}
              \bigl(Y_i-\hat m(X_i)-(T_i-\hat e(X_i))\hat\tau(X_i)\bigr),

    which expands arm-by-arm to ``grf``'s published form
    :math:`\hat\tau + \frac{T}{\hat e}(Y-\hat m-(1-\hat e)\hat\tau)
    - \frac{1-T}{1-\hat e}(Y-\hat m+\hat e\hat\tau)`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tau, T, e_hat, m_hat, Y : ndarray (n,)
        CATE predictions, treatment indicator, propensity, outcome
        regression, and outcome. ``e_hat`` is used as supplied; clip it
        before calling if overlap is a concern.
    target : {'all'}
        Only the ATE score is a single influence function. ``grf``
        estimates ATT/ATC as a plug-in CATE average over the target arm
        *plus* a Hajek-normalised doubly-robust correction, and adds the
        two variance components rather than taking the dispersion of one
        score vector — see :func:`grf_att_atc`.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray (n,)

    This mirrors the most-used ``grf::average_treatment_effect`` targets:
    ``"all"`` (ATE), ``"treated"`` (ATT), ``"control"`` (ATC), and
    ``"overlap"`` (ATO, weighted by ``e(X)(1-e(X))``).

    The estimate is the **doubly-robust AIPW influence-function mean**
    (the estimator grf reports), not a plug-in average of the CATE
    predictions.  Using the forest's own cross-fitted nuisances
    :math:`\\hat m(X)=\\hat E[Y\\mid X]` and :math:`\\hat e(X)=\\hat
    E[T\\mid X]`, the ATE score is

    .. math::
        \\Gamma_i = \\hat\\tau(X_i)
            + \\frac{T_i-\\hat e(X_i)}{\\hat e(X_i)(1-\\hat e(X_i))}
              \\bigl(Y_i-\\hat m(X_i)-(T_i-\\hat e(X_i))\\hat\\tau(X_i)\\bigr),

    (:func:`aipw_scores`).  ATT / ATC follow ``grf``: the plug-in CATE
    mean over the target arm plus a Hajek-normalised doubly-robust
    correction, with the two variance components added
    (:func:`grf_att_atc`).  ``se`` for the ATE is the influence-function
    standard error :math:`\\mathrm{sd}(\\Gamma)/\\sqrt n`.  The overlap
    target (ATO) is ``grf``'s Robinson / R-learner regression of
    ``Y - Y_hat`` on ``W - W_hat`` with an intercept and an HC3 standard
    error (:func:`grf_overlap_ate`); it needs no propensity inversion and
    is reported for continuous treatments as well.  Given the same forest
    outputs all four targets reproduce ``grf`` exactly
    (``tests/reference_parity/test_ml_causal_R_parity.py``).

    For forests fitted with the GRF engine (the default) the CATE entering
    the score is the **out-of-bag** prediction, observation weights follow
    ``equalize_cluster_weights``, standard errors are cluster-robust when
    the forest has clusters, and continuous treatments use grf's
    debiasing weights -- the definitions used by
    ``grf::average_treatment_effect``.  ``X`` / ``T`` may only restate the
    training data.

    Forests with fixed effects (``fe=``) have no propensity.  For them only
    ``target_sample='treated'`` is identified, and it is estimated by
    imputation [borusyak2024revisiting]: unit and period effects are fitted
    on the untreated cells, each treated cell's effect is imputed as
    ``Y - alpha_hat_i - gamma_hat_t``, and the ATT is their mean.  The
    standard error uses the exact linear weights of that estimator,
    clustered by the forest's clusters; ``variance`` chooses how treated
    residuals are centred (``'forest'``: out-of-bag forest prediction, then
    cohort x event-time means; ``'bjs'``: cohort x event-time means only,
    the conservative Borusyak-Jaravel-Spiess convention, identical to
    :func:`statspai.did_imputation`).  The payload also reports
    ``forest_plug_in``, the mean OOB prediction over the same cells, which
    is shrunk toward zero when effects are heterogeneous.

    .. versionchanged:: 1.30.0
       Forests with fixed effects return the imputation ATT for
       ``target_sample='treated'`` instead of raising.

    For other forests the doubly-robust scores exist only for the training
    sample; for other rows the function falls back to the plug-in CATE
    average, sets ``method='plug_in'`` and warns.

    .. versionchanged:: 1.30.0
       ``target_sample='overlap'`` is ``grf``'s R-learner estimator for
       every forest. Earlier releases averaged the AIPW scores with
       ``e(1-e)`` weights for legacy-engine forests, a different (also
       consistent) estimator of the same estimand.

    Parameters
    ----------
    forest : fitted CausalForest
    X, T : arrays, optional
        Rows to aggregate over (default: the training sample).
    target_sample : {'all', 'treated', 'control', 'overlap'}
    alpha : float, default 0.05
    clip : float, default 0.01
        Propensity scores are clipped to ``[clip, 1-clip]`` before the
        inverse-propensity terms of the ATE / ATT / ATC scores. ``grf``
        does not clip; ``clip=0`` reproduces it, and the clip is inert
        whenever all propensities already lie inside the band.
    variance : {'forest', 'bjs'}, default 'forest'
        Forests with fixed effects only (see above); ignored otherwise.
    covariates : 'none', 'auto', list of str or array, default 'none'
        Forests with fixed effects only: covariates in the untreated outcome
        model ``Y(0) = alpha_i + gamma_t + C' beta``.  ``'none'`` is
        :func:`statspai.did_imputation` without covariates (same estimate;
        same standard error with ``variance='bjs'``).  ``'auto'`` adds the
        effect modifiers and covariates that vary within units; use it when a
        time-varying covariate drives the untreated outcome and is not
        itself affected by the treatment.

    """Rescale CATE predictions by their best-linear-predictor calibration.

    Forest CATE predictions are shrunk toward their mean: leaf averaging and
    honest subsampling regularise, so the spread of ``tau_hat`` understates
    the spread of ``tau``.  The calibration regression of
    :func:`calibration_test` estimates the slope ``beta_differential`` of
    the effect signal on the (out-of-bag) predictions; this function returns

        tau_cal(x) = beta_mean * mean(tau_oob)
                     + beta_differential * (tau_hat(x) - mean(tau_oob))

    for the training rows (``newdata=None``, out-of-bag) or for new rows.
    Because the slope is estimated on out-of-bag predictions it tends to 0
    when the effect is homogeneous, so the correction does not manufacture
    heterogeneity.

    Forests with two-way fixed effects and a binary treatment
    (``method='auto'`` or ``'imputation'``): the slope comes from
    regressing imputation scores
    on the out-of-bag predictions over the treated cells (see
    :func:`calibration_test`).  The scores are unbiased for each cell's
    effect, so the slope is a genuine de-attenuation factor, and
    ``tau_bar`` is the mean prediction over treated cells, so
    ``beta_mean * tau_bar`` is the imputation ATT.  In StatsPAI's
    simulations (N = 300 units, T = 8, staggered adoption selected on the
    unit effect, 200 replications) this reduced the RMSE of the treated
    cells' predictions from 0.634 to 0.570 with effects ``(1 + x1)(1 +
    0.2 e)`` and from 0.213 to 0.118 with a constant effect.  The map is
    estimated on treated cells; applying it to other rows assumes it
    carries over.

    ``method='within'`` uses globally within-transformed variables, as
    proposed by [@aytug2026attenuated].  Global two-way demeaning is exact
    only when the effect is homogeneous, so the heterogeneity *test* keeps
    its size, but the slope is not a de-attenuation factor: in StatsPAI's
    simulations (N = 300, T = 6) the OOB predictions had a slope of
    0.65-0.91 on the true effect while ``beta_differential`` stayed at
    0.88-1.07, and calibrated predictions did not reduce RMSE.  A warning
    is emitted in that case.

    .. versionchanged:: 1.30.0
       Forests with fixed effects and a binary treatment calibrate against
       imputation scores by default (``method='within'`` restores the
       earlier regression).

    Parameters
    ----------
    forest : CausalForest
        A forest fitted with the GRF engine (``split_rule="grf"``).
    newdata : array-like, optional
        Effect-modifier rows to calibrate.  ``None`` calibrates the
        out-of-bag predictions of the training rows.  ``X=`` is accepted as
        an alias.
    alpha : float, default 0.05
        Level for the reported slope confidence intervals.
    method : {'auto', 'imputation', 'within'}, default 'auto'
        Forests with fixed effects only; see :func:`calibration_test`.
    covariates : 'none', 'auto', list of str or array, default 'none'
        Imputation regression only; see :func:`average_treatment_effect`.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        ``cate`` (calibrated predictions), ``raw_cate``, ``beta_mean``,
        ``beta_differential``, their ``*_se``, ``calibration`` (the full
        :func:`calibration_test` frame), ``heterogeneity_detected``
        (one-sided 5% test of ``beta_differential > 0``) and ``warnings``.

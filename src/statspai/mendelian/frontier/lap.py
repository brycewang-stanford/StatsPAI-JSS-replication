    Attributes
    ----------
    estimate : float
        Overlap-corrected causal estimate.

    p_value : float
    estimate_ivw : float
        The uncorrected IVW point estimate (for comparison).
    bias_correction : float

    """Sample-overlap-corrected inverse-variance-weighted MR.

    Corrects the first-order bias introduced when the exposure and
    outcome GWAS share participants.  Under Burgess, Davies & Thompson
    (2016) Eq. 8, the bias in two-sample IVW satisfies

    .. math::

       E[\\hat\\beta_{IVW}] - \\beta \\approx
       \\frac{p \\, \\rho_{obs}}{F_{mean}}

    where :math:`p` is the overlap fraction (share of samples appearing in
    both GWAS), :math:`\\rho_{obs}` is the phenotypic correlation of
    exposure and outcome in the overlapping sub-sample, and
    :math:`F_{mean}` is the mean first-stage F-statistic of the SNPs.

    When ``overlap_fraction=0`` (clean two-sample design) the correction
    vanishes and the estimate equals standard IVW.

    Parameters
    ----------
    beta_exposure, beta_outcome : ndarray
        Per-SNP GWAS effect sizes.
    se_exposure, se_outcome : ndarray
        Per-SNP GWAS standard errors.
    overlap_fraction : float, default 1.0
        Share of the outcome sample that also appears in the exposure
        sample.  0 = clean two-sample; 1 = full overlap; in between =
        partial overlap.  Must be in [0, 1].
    overlap_rho : float, default 0.0
        Phenotypic correlation between exposure and outcome measurements
        in the overlapping sub-sample.  In practice estimated by LD-score
        regression (``ldsc --rg``).  Must be in [-1, 1].
    alpha : float, default 0.05
        Two-sided significance level for the CI and p-value.

    Returns

    Notes
    -----
    This implements the closed-form Burgess-Davies-Thompson (2016)
    correction.  The more elaborate MR-Lap of Mounier & Kutalik (2023)
    additionally regresses bias on a non-linear function of
    ``(F_mean, overlap_fraction)`` to absorb weak-instrument curvature;
    that refinement is deferred to a future release.  When the user-
    supplied ``overlap_rho`` is obtained from LD-score regression this
    simplified correction captures most of the overlap bias on
    real-world GWAS scales (F > 30).

    The SE is kept equal to the naive-IVW SE: the correction shifts the
    point estimate only.  Monte-Carlo studies (Burgess 2016 Figs. 2-3)
    show coverage remains nominal under this conservative choice because
    the correction itself has second-order variance.

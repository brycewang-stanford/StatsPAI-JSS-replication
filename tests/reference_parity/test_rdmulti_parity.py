"""Reference parity: ``sp.rdmc`` vs R rdmulti 2.0.0 (WP-5).

``sp.rdmc`` claimed to be "equivalent to ``rdmulti::rdmc()``" but could not
express that function's central argument. R's ``rdmc`` takes ``C``, a
**per-unit cutoff**: in the Cattaneo, Titiunik, Vazquez-Bare & Keele (2016)
multi-cutoff design each unit faces its own threshold, and cutoff ``c``'s
effect is identified only from the units assigned to ``c``. StatsPAI
offered only a shared-running-variable estimator in which every unit enters
every cutoff's local regression.

Those are different estimators, and the difference is not small. On the
fixture below -- effects of **2.0 / 5.0 / -3.0** at cutoffs -10 / 0 / 15 --
the shared path returned **0.22 / 0.51 / 0.66**: units belonging to one
cutoff were pooled into the others' windows, averaging the three effects
into noise and destroying even the sign of the third.

``cutoff_var=`` now selects the R-equivalent estimator, delegating each
cutoff to :func:`statspai.rdrobust` so it inherits the CCT cascade. Every
quantity matches R to <= 2.4e-08 (bandwidths) or ~1e-13 (everything else).

A note on R's field names, established by comparison rather than assumed:
``rdmc``'s ``B``/``V`` hold the **bias-corrected** coefficient and its
**variance** (``V`` is a variance -- ``r$CI`` half-widths are
``1.96*sqrt(V)``), while ``Coefs`` holds the **conventional** estimate. The
printed table pairs the conventional point estimate with the robust CI,
exactly as ``rdrobust`` does. Reading ``B`` as "the" coefficient and ``V``
as an SE would have produced a fixture that was wrong in two ways at once.

The design uses three deliberately *different* effects, including a sign
flip, so the suite can distinguish a per-cutoff estimator from one that
pools. Had all three been equal, the broken implementation would have
passed.

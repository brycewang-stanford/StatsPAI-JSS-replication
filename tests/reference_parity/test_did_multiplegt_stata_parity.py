"""Reference parity: ``sp.did_multiplegt`` DID_M vs Stata ``did_multiplegt_old``.

The dCDH (2020) static DID_M conditions switchers/stayers on the baseline
treatment ``d_{t-1}`` and sign-flips switch-off cells. Prior to the
baseline-conditioning fix, ``sp.did_multiplegt`` pooled all switchers/stayers in
each period under a single majority sign, which (i) contaminated the control
trend with already-treated stayers and (ii) mixed switch-on/off effects --
giving 0.396 on the on/off DGP below (true effect 0.6) and -0.0170 on mpdta.

The Stata reference values were produced by ``did_multiplegt (old) ...`` on the
identical panels (Stata 18 MP, ssc ``did_multiplegt`` old mode); see
``Paper-DiD-JAE/replication/did_multiplegt/``. StatsPAI now matches them to ~1e-8.

"""Reference parity: CS event-study pre-periods under ``base_period='varying'``.

``sp.callaway_santanna``'s post-treatment dynamics have long matched R ``did``
and Stata ``csdid`` three-way to machine precision.  The **pre-treatment**
placebos did not, for two separate reasons:

1. StatsPAI defaults to ``base_period='universal'`` while R ``did`` and Stata
   ``csdid`` default to ``'varying'``.  Under 'universal' every pre-period is
   differenced against the single reference g−1, so the placebo coefficients
   are a different (also valid) estimand — not a bug, a different convention.
2. Under ``'varying'`` StatsPAI *omitted* the e = −1 coefficient. The (g, t)
   grid builder skipped ``t == g − 1 − anticipation`` unconditionally, on the
   reasoning that it is the reference period.  That is only true under the
   universal scheme; under 'varying' the base for t = g−1 is g−2, so
   ATT(g, g−1) is a genuine estimable placebo.  ⚠️ corrected — the cell is
   now reported.

With ``base_period='varying'`` the whole event study — every pre- and
post-treatment coefficient — now agrees with both references.

Reference values
----------------
Three-way reconciliation on the canonical ``did::mpdta`` panel (500 counties,
2003-2007, cohorts 2004/2006/2007).  R ``did`` 2.3.0 and Stata ``csdid``
agree with each other to machine precision on every cell below.  Source:
the WP-A cross-software reconciliation (DiD reconciliation study,
``parity/DISCREPANCY_TAXONOMY.md`` §1), which reports them to 6 decimals.

Data provenance
---------------
``tests/orig_parity/data/02_mpdta_original.csv``, SHA256
``1b789c34e12ff490b2f432217a1f70af334117523eb44d20eb842ed92a574661`` —
verified byte-identical to a rebuild of ``did::mpdta`` from the R package.
The checksum is asserted here so the fixture cannot drift underneath the
pinned reference numbers.

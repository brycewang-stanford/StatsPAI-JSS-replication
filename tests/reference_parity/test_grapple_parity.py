"""Analytical parity: sp.grapple robust-adjusted profile-score MR recovery.

GRAPPLE (Barber et al. 2018): profile likelihood MR with robust Tukey
biweight loss. Under a clean DGP (no pleiotropic outliers) it recovers the
planted constant effect analytically. Analytical evidence tier (known-truth
recovery on a deterministic DGP; the test is loose because the biweight
loss targets heterogeneity, not bias reduction).

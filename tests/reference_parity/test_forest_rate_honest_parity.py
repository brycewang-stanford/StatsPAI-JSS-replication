"""Analytical parity: sp.rate and sp.honest_variance known-truth anchors.

Both aggregate a fitted ``sp.causal_forest``; neither has a cross-package
reference, so the honest grade is ``analytical-only`` — verified against a
known DGP truth and against exact structural identities.

``sp.honest_variance``
    The reported point ``ate`` is *by construction* the sample mean of the
    forest's own CATE predictions, so ``ate == mean(forest.effect(X))``
    holds to machine precision (an exact identity, BLAS-portable because
    both sides use the same predictions). On a homogeneous constant-effect
    DGP the mean CATE recovers the true effect within a bounded band, and
    the half-sample SE / CI are well-formed (SE >= 0, CI brackets the ATE).

``sp.rate`` (Yadlowsky et al. 2025, rank-weighted average treatment effect)
    AUTOC measures whether the prioritisation score (the forest CATE)
    correctly orders the *true* heterogeneous effect. On a DGP with strong
    heterogeneity ``tau(x) = 1 + 2 x0`` the forest prioritises correctly, so
    AUTOC is positive and its CI excludes zero. On a constant-effect DGP
    there is nothing to prioritise, so AUTOC is ~0 and its CI contains zero.
    RATE/TOC values are not bit-portable across BLAS backends, so the anchor
    is the sign / null structure, not a pinned value.

Forests are seeded (``random_state``) so the test is deterministic.

"""Analytical parity: sp.bcf_factor_exposure identities + effect recovery.

``sp.bcf_factor_exposure`` projects a high-dimensional exposure vector onto
factors, runs a Bayesian Causal Forest (BCF) per binarised factor, and sums
the per-factor ATEs into a total mixture ATE. It has no cross-package
reference, so the honest grade is ``analytical-only``.

Two anchors:

1. **Exact adding-up identities.** By construction the total mixture ATE is
   the sum of the per-factor ATEs and the total variance is the sum of the
   per-factor variances (local-independence aggregation). Both hold to
   machine precision.

2. **Known-effect recovery.** With supplied one-hot loadings that select two
   exposures carrying *known* binary treatment effects (2.0 and 1.0), the
   per-factor ATEs and their total recover the planted effects within a band
   (BCF is a regularised tree ensemble, so the band is a few tenths, not
   machine precision).

The design is deterministic (fixed RNG + ``random_state``).

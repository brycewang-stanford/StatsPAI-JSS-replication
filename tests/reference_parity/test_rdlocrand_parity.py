"""Reference parity: local randomization and power vs R rdlocrand 2.0 / rdpower 3.0.

Covers ``sp.rdrandinf``, ``sp.rdwinselect`` and ``sp.rdpower`` (WP-4).

What this suite does NOT pin
----------------------------
The **randomization** p-value. It is a draw from the RNG, and R's Mersenne
stream is not reproducible from Python, so pinning it would be pinning
noise. Only the deterministic quantities are asserted against R -- the
observed statistic, the asymptotic p-value and the window counts -- and the
randomization p-value is checked by its sampling behaviour instead
(``test_randomization_pvalue_is_close_to_asymptotic``). Asserting equality
there would be a test that passes for the wrong reason.

Three defects were found by writing it, all in quantities no test had
looked at:

1. **The asymptotic p-value used the wrong reference distribution.** The
   standard error is Welch's, but the p-value referred it to a ``t`` with
   ``n1 + n0 - 2`` degrees of freedom -- pooled df for an unpooled SE, which
   is not any single test. rdlocrand uses the normal, which is also what
   "asymptotic" means. On rdsenate at w = +/-5 the old form reported
   1.68e-10 where rdlocrand reports 2.49e-11: a factor of 6.7.

2. **``ranksum`` was a different statistic.** StatsPAI returned
   ``|U - mu| / sigma`` from scipy's Mann-Whitney U with the no-ties
   variance; rdlocrand uses the standardised rank sum of the *control*
   group with the empirical rank variance ``s^2``, which is tie-robust.
   The senate running variable is heavily tied, so the two differed by
   2-3x. The sign was also discarded.

3. **``sp.rdpower`` had no data mode at all.** R's ``rdpower(data = ...)``
   runs ``rdrobust`` internally and takes its robust bias-corrected SE;
   StatsPAI only offered a design-stage calculator with a different
   parameterisation, so R's numbers were unreachable. Data mode now agrees
   to 4.2e-14 -- which it can only do because the WP-1/WP-2 cascade work
   made ``se_robust`` itself exact.

Also: ``statistic='ttest'`` is accepted as an alias for ``'diffmeans'``,
as in rdlocrand, where both names select the same branch.

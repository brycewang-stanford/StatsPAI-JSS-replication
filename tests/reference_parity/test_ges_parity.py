"""Analytical parity: sp.ges recovers correct CPDAGs (skeleton + v-structures).

Greedy Equivalence Search on known linear-Gaussian DGPs:

* collider X -> Z <- Y (X ⊥ Y): the v-structure is recovered with both edges
  directed INTO Z and NO spurious X--Y edge (the explaining-away edge the
  acyclicity-unconstrained search used to add);
* chain X -> Y -> Z: the CPDAG is the undirected skeleton X--Y--Z with no
  X--Z edge (Markov-equivalence class of the chain).

Analytical evidence tier (known-truth structure recovery on deterministic
DGPs; guards the acyclicity + DAG->CPDAG correctness fix).

"""Self-contained recovery test for the causal-forest AIPW ATE/ATT.

No R, no fixtures: builds a clean-overlap deterministic DGP with an
analytically known average treatment effect and asserts that
``sp.causal_forest.average_treatment_effect`` (the doubly-robust AIPW
estimand grf reports) recovers the truth within 4 standard errors.  It
also asserts that the **plug-in** mean of the CATE predictions is
materially more biased than the AIPW estimate, which is the whole reason
the headline aggregation is AIPW --- and, since 1.29, the reason
``cf.ate()`` returns the AIPW estimate rather than the plug-in one.

This is the Tier-1 (no external language required) evidence behind the
module-13 causal-forest parity row; the cross-language agreement with
``grf`` itself is checked in ``test_grf_parity.py`` against a committed
grf fixture, and re-verified live in ``tests/r_parity/13_causal_forest``.

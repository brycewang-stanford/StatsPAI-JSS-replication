r"""Monte Carlo CI coverage under *robustness* DGPs.

The canonical Track B suite (``test_coverage.py``) checks that 95% CIs
hit nominal coverage on **well-specified** DGPs.  This sibling suite
checks the same estimators on DGPs that violate or stress the
identification assumptions (weak instruments, heterogeneous DiD timing,
severe propensity-score overlap loss).

The contract is intentionally different from the canonical suite.  These
tests do **not** assert that empirical coverage equals the nominal 0.95.
They assert that empirical coverage falls within a *documented band*
that we have measured at pilot time.  The band serves two purposes:

1. ``regression``: if the band is violated (coverage drops below the
   floor, or jumps above the ceiling), some estimator-internal change
   has shifted the calibration of the inference procedure on this DGP.
   Either the estimator improved (e.g. a fix lifts coverage) or it
   regressed (e.g. a refactor broke an SE term).  Either way, a
   maintainer should investigate.

2. ``honest documentation``: weak instruments are *expected* to under-
   cover with HC1 SEs.  AIPW with severe overlap loss is expected to
   over-cover (because the IF blows up).  Pretending these failures
   don't exist would be marketing, not science.  The bands let us
   record the magnitude of the textbook failure mode while still using
   the band as a regression guard against silent drift.

Bands were measured by direct simulation at pilot time and are
reproducible from a fixed seed schedule.  See ``run_robustness_b1000.py``
for the explicit-rate harness used in §5.3 of the JSS draft.

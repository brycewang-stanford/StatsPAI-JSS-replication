# Published reference values — external parity anchors

Each simulated replica in `sp.datasets` is calibrated so that the
canonical estimator recovers output in the neighbourhood of the
**published numbers on the ORIGINAL data**.  This document is the
primary-source index for every such claim.

Several loaders now return the **real extract by default** and keep the
replica behind `simulated=True`: `card_1995`, `lee_2008_senate`,
`california_prop99` (see the `source` column of
`sp.datasets.list_datasets()`).  The "replica target" lines below describe
the `simulated=True` branch only.

## Callaway-Sant'Anna mpdta

| Simple ATT | -0.0454 (SE 0.0113) | `did` R package vignette, aggte type="simple" |

with Multiple Time Periods. *Journal of Econometrics*, 225(2), 200-230.

`sp.datasets.mpdta()` replica target: simple ATT ≈ -0.04 (sign and
order of magnitude match; exact numerical R parity not claimed
because the data is simulated).

## Card (1995) returns to schooling

| Statistic | Value | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OLS β(educ) | 0.075 | Card (1995) Table 2, col 2 |
| IV β(educ), nearc4 | 0.132 | Card (1995) Table 2, col 5 |
| IV β(educ), nearc2 | 0.097 | Card (1995) Table 2, col 6 |

Citation: Card, D. (1995). Using Geographic Variation in College Proximity
to Estimate the Return to Schooling. In Christofides et al. (eds.),
*Aspects of Labour Market Behaviour*.

`sp.datasets.card_1995(simulated=True)` replica target: OLS ≈ 0.11,
IV ≈ 0.142 (IV > OLS, the "Card puzzle").  Exact numerical values differ
because the DGP is simulated.  The default `card_1995()` is the real NLSYM
extract (n = 3,010); with `exper expersq black south smsa` as controls it
gives OLS 0.0740 and 2SLS 0.1323.  The table above is a neighbourhood
anchor for these numbers, not an exact target.

## LaLonde (1986) / Dehejia-Wahba (1999) NSW

| Experimental ATT on re78 (NSW only) | $1,794 (SE $633) | Dehejia-Wahba (1999) Table 2 |

| PSM ATT on NSW+PSID-1 | $1,794 | Dehejia-Wahba (1999) Table 4 |
| Covariate-adj OLS on NSW+PSID-1 | $218 (bias remains) | Dehejia-Wahba (1999) Table 3 |

  Studies: Reevaluating the Evaluation of Training Programs. *JASA*

`sp.datasets.nsw_lalonde()` and `nsw_dw()` replica targets: match
published numbers within $500 on the experimental subset; the
naive-OLS bias on the NSW+PSID combination matches within $500.

## Lee (2008) close-election RD (U.S. House)

| Statistic | Value | Source |

| RD jump at margin = 0 | 0.080 (SE 0.008) | Lee (2008) Table 2, col 1 |

Citation: Lee, D. (2008). Randomized experiments from non-random
selection in U.S. House elections. *Journal of Econometrics* 142,

`sp.datasets.lee_2008_senate(simulated=True)` replica target: 0.08.
The default `lee_2008_senate()` is **not** Lee's House data: it is the
U.S. Senate extract of Cattaneo, Frandsen & Titiunik (2015,
`cattaneo2015randomization`) distributed with R `rdrobust` (vote share in
percentage points), whose reference is R / Stata `rdrobust` itself
(Track A module `06_rd`: conventional 7.414, robust 7.507), not the table
above.

## Angrist-Krueger (1991) quarter-of-birth

Attendance Affect Schooling and Earnings? *QJE* 106(4), 979-1014.

`sp.datasets.angrist_krueger_1991()` replica target: IV ≈ 0.10 by
construction.  The original NBER public data is needed for exact
numerical replication.

## California Prop 99 (Abadie-Diamond-Hainmueller 2010)

| Statistic | Value | Source |

`sp.datasets.california_prop99(simulated=True)` replica target: ATT ≈ -15
packs/capita.  The default `california_prop99()` is the real ADH panel.

## Basque Country Terrorism (Abadie-Gardeazabal 2003)

`sp.datasets.basque_terrorism()` replica target: gap ≈ -0.855.

## German Reunification (Abadie-Diamond-Hainmueller 2015)

## Hernán & Robins, *Causal Inference: What If* — NHEFS (REAL data)

Unlike every anchor above, `sp.datasets.nhefs()` ships the **real,
public-domain** NHEFS extract that Hernán & Robins use throughout Part II
of the textbook (NHANES I follow-up; re-packaged from the MIT-licensed
`causaldata`). Because the data are genuine, StatsPAI is held to the
book's **actual published figures**, not merely their neighbourhood, and
each statistic carries a same-bytes R gold reference (paired scripts
`tests/orig_parity/06–11_nhefs_*.{py,R}`). Effect of quitting smoking
(`qsmk`) on 10-year weight change (`wt82_71`, kg) and mortality (`death`).

Citation: Hernán, M.A. & Robins, J.M. (2020). *Causal Inference: What If*.
Boca Raton: Chapman & Hall/CRC.

Headline: across the textbook's g-methods, **StatsPAI reproduces the book
to the printed precision** (the Chapter 15 regression coefficients match
to four decimals), and **StatsPAI agrees with an independent base-R /
`survival` / `EValue` reference on the same CSV bytes** — usually to 3–4
decimals. The Chapter 15 closed-form regressions are an exact match; the
IP-weighted, g-formula, g-estimation, and survival quantities embed minor
documented convention choices (normalized weights; additive encoding) that
keep them within ~2% of the book and the R gold. This is
the first epidemiology-stack (vs econometrics-stack) parity certification
in the repository. Pinned regression tests live in
`tests/external_parity/test_whatif_nhefs.py`.

## How to add a new parity anchor

1. Add a DGP to `src/statspai/datasets/_canonical.py` that calibrates
   the canonical estimator's output to the published value ± 50%.
2. Expose via `sp.datasets.<name>()` and register in `list_datasets()`.
3. Add a pinned test in `tests/external_parity/test_published_replications.py`:
   - One test pinning the output to 4 decimals (drift guard).
   - One test asserting the output is in a reasonable neighbourhood
     of the published value on the original data (calibration check).
4. Document the primary-source citation in this file.

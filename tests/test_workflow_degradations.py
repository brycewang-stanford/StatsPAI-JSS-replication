"""Tests for the workflow-layer degradation tracking surface.

CLAUDE.md §3.7 ("失败要响亮") forbids silent ``except Exception: pass``
in best-effort orchestration code.  These tests pin down the contract:
when a sub-step of ``sp.paper`` / ``sp.causal_workflow`` /
``sp.assumption_audit`` fails, the user must see a
``WorkflowDegradedWarning`` *and* be able to introspect what was skipped
via ``draft.degradations`` / ``workflow.degradations``.

The tests deliberately trigger failures by feeding pathological inputs
(non-numeric covariates, CI shaped wrong, ``cite()`` raising, etc.)
rather than by mocking, so they double as regression tests against
future code paths that try to silently swallow these errors again.

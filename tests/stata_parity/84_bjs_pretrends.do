* Module 84: BJS pre-treatment lead vector.
*   StatsPAI:  sp.did_imputation(..., pretrend_method="bjs")
*   R:         didimputation::did_imputation  (horizons only -- see 84_bjs_pretrends.R)
*   Stata:     did_imputation (Borusyak, SSC S458957)  <-- this file
*
* Module 16 pins the pooled ATT. This one pins the LEAD VECTOR, which is
* where the v1.23.0 correctness fix lived: StatsPAI previously reported
* the fect/did2s in-sample residual means while documenting this command,
* and the two differ by the untreated unit share.
*
* pretrends(3) estimates exactly three lead indicators and pools every
* earlier relative time into the omitted category. The fixture gives each
* treated cohort strictly more pre-periods than that, so `autosample` has
* nothing to drop and all three sides estimate on identical rows.
*
* Tolerance: rel_est < 1e-6, rel_se < 1e-6. This module is what exposed
* the analytic-variance defect fixed in v1.23.0; both are now inside the
* budget. See compare.py::TOLERANCES.

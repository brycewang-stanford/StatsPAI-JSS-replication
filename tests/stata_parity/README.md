# `tests/stata_parity/` — cross-language parity harness against Stata

This directory is the **StatsPAI ↔ Stata** sibling of
[`tests/r_parity/`](../r_parity/): each module pair runs the same
calibrated replica on both sides, dumps a full-precision JSON
result, and `tests/r_parity/compare.py` joins the three sides
(StatsPAI, R, Stata) into a single 3-way Track A parity table for
the JSS Appendix B.

The harness is read by the same `compare.py` that drives the R
side — there is **one** comparator and **one** tolerance budget
(`compare.py::TOLERANCES`). Parity is a property of the estimator,
not of the reference language, so we deliberately do not register
a separate budget for the Stata comparison. Known Stata convention
gaps that exceed the shared headline budget are explicitly enumerated
in `compare.py::STATA_HEADLINE_GAP_EXCEPTIONS`.

## What's here

```
tests/stata_parity/
├── README.md
├── _common.do            # shared scaffolding: JSON writer (file-based, survives `mata clear`)
├── _quick_compare.py     # ad-hoc 3-way comparator while developing modules
├── NN_<method>.do        # one .do per module
├── logs/                 # Stata's per-run .smcl/.log + the JSON-row tmp files
└── results/
    └── NN_<method>_Stata.json   # full-precision results, joined by compare.py
```

Each `.do` file imports `../r_parity/data/NN_<name>.csv` (the same
bytes the R side reads), runs the canonical Stata reference, and
writes one row per parity statistic to
`results/NN_<name>_Stata.json` via the helpers in `_common.do`.

### Modules **without** a materialized Stata JSON

Four of the 89 Python modules have no Stata artifact.
`compare.py::STATA_SKIP_REASON` records the exact reason and the 3-way table
prints it explicitly. Every reason was re-measured against a licensed Stata 18
runtime with SSC reachable (2026-08-06, re-checked 2026-09-22), so none of
them rests on a stale "not installed here" claim.

**No Stata implementation exists** (verified 2026-08-06 --
`ssc describe` returns `r(601)` and the command does not resolve locally):

- **77 ddd** — the Ortiz-Villavicencio/Sant'Anna triple-difference estimator
  ships only as the R package `triplediff`.
- **79 didff** — the Roth-Sant'Anna functional-form test ships only as the R
  package `didFF` (GitHub, not CRAN).
- **80 contdid** — the CGS continuous-treatment estimator ships only as the R
  package `contdid` (GitHub, not CRAN).

**Runtime version** — the candidate reference exists but not in this runtime:

- **13 causal_forest** — Stata 19's official `cate` is the candidate
  causal-forest/AIPW reference; the verified runtime here is Stata 18 and
  `which cate` fails.

### Modules closed in the 2026-09-22 pass

| Module | Stata reference | Worst py-Stata rel | Note |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| 18 augsynth | audited Mata bridge of `augsynth` 0.2.0 | 1.7e-8 (est), 6.5e-9 (pre-RMSPE) | `allsynth` refuses the fixture (`K + 2` donors) and, where it runs, uses `synth` V-weights plus per-period ridge -- a different estimand. The R golden sits 7.9e-6 from both exact solvers because `augsynth::synth_qp` runs OSQP at eps 1e-8; tightened to 1e-13 augsynth agrees with Mata/numpy to 1e-11 |
| 19 gsynth | audited Mata bridge of `gsynth`'s convention | 2.2e-15 (est), 1.7e-14 (pre-RMSE) | `fect_stata` has no `method(gsynth)`; its `ife` is the IFEct EM on all untreated cells (converged R `fect(method="ife")` = -0.33206, Stata -0.33206, 3.8e-7 apart) and is kept as the unjoined `ife_att_avg_fect_stata` diagnostic. The old skip reason's `0.679854` was not reproducible |
| 04 csdid | `csdid` + `estat group` | 6.2e-15 (fixed-share SE) | `group_overall_fixedshare` joins `sp.aggte(share_variance=False)` to `estat group`'s `GAverage`, pinning the 0.27% fixed-vs-estimated cohort-share SE convention as a row rather than a note |

### Modules closed in the second 2026-08-06 pass

Three more, after the py<->Stata budget contract was added and the remaining
skip reasons were re-measured rather than re-read:

| Module | Stata reference | Worst py-Stata rel | Note |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| 66 spatial_gmm | audited Mata GS2SLS bridge | 7.3e-16 | estimates *and* SEs; `spregress, gs2sls` uses a wider instrument set and lands 1.5e-2 away, so the do-file builds the documented `stsls(W2X=FALSE)` estimator directly |
| 72 tmle | audited Mata bridge | 1.9e-9 est / 1.4e-11 se | Stata ships no TMLE and `eltmle` wraps the same R package, so the do-file implements the published per-arm fluctuation |
| 70 policy_tree | audited Mata search | 1.4e-16 | **depth 1 only** — exact depth-2 needs policytree's incremental search and a heuristic would be worse evidence than an honest two-sided row |
| 68 demean_within | `bysort id: egen mean` | 8.8e-15 | the third implementation exposed a naming bug that had kept 3 of 10 statistics out of the py-R join too |
| 69 balance_panel | distinct-period count | 0 (exact) | |
| 65 spatial | `spregress, ml` | 5.1e-8 | all 14 SAR/SEM/SDM parameters; the old skip reason claimed a "distinct ML/estimand convention" and was simply wrong |
| 67 panel_glm | `logit i.id` / `ppmlhdfe` | 1.8e-9 | point estimates only; no `vce()` setting reproduces fixest's absorbed-FE GLM variance |

### Modules closed in the first 2026-08-06 pass

Seven modules that previously appeared in the list above now carry
materialized artifacts. Three of them had been skipped on the grounds that
the package was "not installed in the verified local runtime", which stopped
being true once `did_multiplegt_old`, `did_multiplegt_dyn` and `cic` were
checked; two more were skipped as "no Stata implementation" when in fact
`did2s` is on SSC and `pretrends` has a maintained Stata port.

| Module | Stata reference | Worst py-Stata rel | Note |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| 78 multiplegt_dyn | `did_multiplegt_dyn` | 2.1e-15 | 10 joined rows across the absorbing and switch-off designs |
| 81 didm | `did_multiplegt_old` | 3.2e-15 | `dynamic_1` deliberately not joined; see the do-file header |
| 82 staggered | `staggered` (SSC) | 3.7e-15 | all 33 rows join, including both the Neyman and adjusted SEs |
| 85 twfe_event_study | `reghdfe` | 5.7e-14 | estimates and SEs three-way machine level since 1.24.0 (sp.event_study applies the same nested-K rule) |
| 86 fect | `fect` (fect_stata, GitHub) | 1e-9 (fe / mc headline), 1.5e-7 (ife headline) | all three outcome models on one staggered panel; fect_stata's own EM stopping rule leaves the ife fixed point at ~1e-7 while R/Python run the same iteration path to 1e-10 |
| 73 did2s | `did2s` | 1.3e-14 (SE), 2.4e-12 (estimate) | estimate and corrected two-stage SE three-way: sp.gardner_did's default `vce='analytic'` builds the same two-stage influence function as R/Stata `did2s`; the pre-correction stage-2-only SE is kept as the unjoined `static_ATT_stage2_se` row |
| 71 dml_family | `ddml` | 6.9e-7 | shared fold partition via `foldvar()`; PLIV gap is ddml's second-stage intercept |
| 75 stacked | hand-built stack + `reghdfe` | 7.1e-13 | three independent stack constructions agree; SEs differ by a constant dof factor |
| 76 pretrends | `pretrends` | 5.1e-4 | inside the registered 1e-3 budget; the closed-form LR row agrees to 1e-15 |
| 74 cic | `cic` (`discrete_ci`) | 6.0e-3 | 8 of 9 deciles bit-identical; `qte_50` and the ATT are a documented tie-break gap |
| 88 rdbwselect | `rdbwselect` | 3.7e-9 | 64 of the 68 bandwidths the R side pins; the four `certwo` cells are R-only because Stata rdbwselect 10.0.0 errors on that selector. Worst cell is the `msesum`/`cersum` bias bandwidth |
| 89 rdms | `rdms` | 3.3e-9 | three boundary points x (bias-corrected est, conventional est, bandwidth, effective N each side); the six effective sample sizes are exactly equal across Python, R and Stata |

`08_dml`, `31_dfl`, `32_rif`, `53_cr2`, `54_twoway_cluster`, and
`56_multiway_cluster` are deliberately labelled audited Stata/Mata algorithm
bridges rather than packaged-command references: `08_dml` implements the
deterministic linear-nuisance DML2 PLR score rather than treating `ddml` as
canonical for the published DoubleML R algorithm, `31_dfl` implements the DFL
logit reweighting algebra directly, `32_rif` avoids a nonbaseline `rifhdreg`
install, `53_cr2` implements clubSandwich-style CR2/CR3 because Stata's
built-in clustered covariance is CR1, and `54`/`56` implement the
CGM/sandwich multiway-cluster convention directly while keeping `reghdfe`
SEs as diagnostic convention rows.
## Running

End-to-end run for a single module (assumes the matching
`tests/r_parity/NN_<name>.py` has already produced the CSV in
`tests/r_parity/data/`):

```bash
cd tests/stata_parity
/Applications/Stata/StataMP.app/Contents/MacOS/stata-mp -b -q do 11_psm.do
python3 ../r_parity/compare.py
```

Run everything:

```bash
cd tests/stata_parity
for dofile in [0-9][0-9]_*.do; do
  /Applications/Stata/StataMP.app/Contents/MacOS/stata-mp -b -q do "${dofile}"
done
python3 ../r_parity/compare.py
```

The same critical Stata smoke path is available through pytest:

```bash
pytest tests/test_parity_runtime.py -m external_parity_runtime --no-cov
```

## Tier A fixture lock

The Stata-side `.do` files, shared helper, golden `_Stata.json` outputs,
environment notes, and reproduction report are included in
[`../r_parity/TIER_A_FIXTURE_LOCK.json`](../r_parity/TIER_A_FIXTURE_LOCK.json).
The fast contract suite verifies the lock without requiring a local
Stata license:

```bash
python scripts/tier_a_fixture_lock.py
pytest -o addopts='' tests/test_parity_harness_contract.py
```

After an intentional Stata fixture refresh, review the JSON/table diff
and then run `python scripts/tier_a_fixture_lock.py --write` so the
hash-level fixture contract moves with the audited evidence.

## Stata environment

- **Edition tested**: Stata 18 MP on the current parity machine.
  None of the 53 materialized modules trip the matrix limit.
- **`set type double`** is forced in `_common.do` so
  `import delimited` reads the CSV bytes at full IEEE-754 precision;
  without it, Stata's float default would cost 4-5 orders of
  magnitude in parity (1e-12 → 1e-8 on OLS).
- **JSON writer**: file-based (under `logs/<module>.rows.tmp`) rather
  than Mata-resident, because several Stata commands (`rdrobust`,
  `csdid`, `sdid`, others) call `mata mata clear` internally and
  would wipe a Mata accumulator mid-run.

## Required SSC / community packages

```stata
ssc install ivreg2 ranktest csdid drdid did_imputation eventstudyinteract \
    jwdid hdfe synth rdrobust rddensity honestdid bacondecomp \
    sfcross sfpanel sensemakr avar ppmlhdfe paramed evalue
```

`reghdfe`, `sdid`, `psmatch2`, and `oaxaca` were already on the test
machine; `mixed`, `melogit`, `xtfrontier`, `frontier`, `regress`,
`ivregress`, `teffects psmatch`, `xtreg`, `var`, `arima`, `qreg`,
`tobit`, `nbreg`, `heckman`, `mlogit`, `ologit`, `clogit`, `probit`,
`oprobit`, `xtabond`, and `newey` are Stata built-ins.

## How the JSS paper uses this

[`Paper-JSS/manuscript/sections/appendix.tex`](../../Paper-JSS/manuscript/sections/appendix.tex)
`\input`s [`manuscript/tables/appendix_b_parity.tex`](../../Paper-JSS/manuscript/tables/appendix_b_parity.tex),
which is a copy of `tests/r_parity/results/parity_table_3way.tex`
refreshed by `compare.py`. Re-running `compare.py` after any module
change is sufficient to keep the appendix in sync.

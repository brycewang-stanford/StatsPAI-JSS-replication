* The shared R/Python CSV encodes never-treated units as first_treat==0.
* Borusyak's Stata did_imputation expects missing Ei for never-treated
* units, so recode before estimation; otherwise those units are read as
* treated from period 0 and the pooled tau is not like-for-like.
replace first_treat = . if first_treat == 0

* did_imputation syntax: did_imputation depvar id time gvar [, options]
* `autosample` drops never-imputable observations (those that have no
* untreated comparison) silently.

* did_imputation posts e(b) and e(V); the headline pooled ATT row is
* e(b)["tau", *] -- check specific layout below. Default with no
* horizons supplied is a single pooled "tau" row.

matrix B = e(b)
matrix V = e(V)

* The estimator stores a single tau row.

# StatsPAI BJS pre-trend parity (R side) -- Module 84.
#
# Runs didimputation::did_imputation (Butts & Borusyak, CRAN) on the same
# CSV bytes as the Python side.
#
# This side pins the POST-treatment horizons only, and that boundary is a
# finding rather than a shortcut. R and Stata implement different
# pre-trend normalisations and neither package exposes the other's:
#
#   * Stata did_imputation, pretrends(k) estimates exactly k lead
#     indicators and pools every earlier relative time into the omitted
#     category, so the leads are differenced against that pooled block.
#   * R didimputation takes `pretrends` as a flag, not a count. With
#     pretrends = TRUE it estimates a lead for every pre-period and omits
#     relative time -1, so the leads are differenced against -1.
#
# The two therefore fit different designs, and the difference is not a
# vertical shift: on this fixture the R leads and the Stata leads do not
# even have the same spacing, because changing the number of lead dummies
# changes what the omitted block contains. Passing pretrends = 3L to R
# returns an NA row and a coercion warning rather than Stata's object.
#
# sp.did_imputation(pretrend_method="bjs") implements the Stata
# convention, which is the one its docstring names, so the lead vector is
# pinned against Stata in 84_bjs_pretrends.do and the R side stays on the
# horizons where all three implementations answer the same question.
#
# Tolerance: rel_est < 1e-6, rel_se < 1e-6. Packaging this module is
# what exposed the variance defect fixed in v1.23.0: StatsPAI's analytic
# standard errors came from a balanced-panel approximation to the
# fixed-effect projection and were 4.9-13% away here (36% on the headline)
# while this R side and the Stata side agreed with each other to ~3e-9.
# Both are now inside the budget.

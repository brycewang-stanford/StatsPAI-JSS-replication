"""Parity comparator: read all results/<module>_{py,R}.json pairs and
(optionally) the sister Stata-side JSONs in
``tests/stata_parity/results/<module>_Stata.json``, then emit:

  * parity_table.md       -- human-readable Markdown (3-way when Stata available)
  * parity_table.tex      -- LaTeX longtable, 4-col R-only baseline (legacy)
  * parity_table_3way.tex -- LaTeX longtable, 5-col with Stata column;
                             this is the version the JSS appendix \\input{}s.

Tolerance budget (pre-registered, NEXT-STEPS / JSS plan §5.2):

  * machine-level point-estimate references:   rel_diff < 1e-6
  * iterative / cross-fit (DiD, RD, SCM, DML): rel_diff < 1e-3
  * bootstrap / placebo CI half-widths:        abs_diff < 0.05 * SE
  * Honest-DiD CI bounds:                      abs_diff < 0.05

The same tolerance applies to the StatsPAI <-> Stata comparison: we
do not register a separate budget for the Stata side; one budget per
module is the single source of truth. Stata-side implementation
convention gaps that exceed that budget must be explicitly listed in
``STATA_HEADLINE_GAP_EXCEPTIONS``.

Verdict assignment is per-module, not per-row, because some rows
(e.g. SE-with-documented-convention-gap, default-h selector) are
expected NOT to pass at the strict tolerance and are recorded with
an explicit rationale in the module's `extra` block.

    """Return unregistered py<->Stata headline-budget violations.

    The R leg has always been a contract: every module registers a tolerance
    in ``TOLERANCES`` and the parity index fails loudly when a committed
    golden exceeds it. The Stata leg was only ever *displayed* --- the
    three-way table printed ``rel py-Stata`` and nothing compared it to the
    budget. That is how ``10_honest_did`` sat at 1.5e-3 against a registered
    5e-4 for as long as the module has existed without anyone noticing.

    This function closes that asymmetry. A module fails when its headline
    rows join a Stata column that exceeds the module's own registered
    point-estimate tolerance, unless it is registered in
    ``STATA_HEADLINE_GAP_EXCEPTIONS`` with the measurement and the reason.
    Registering is deliberately not the same as passing: the exception text
    is rendered into the three-way table and the paper appendix, so the cost
    of claiming one is that a reviewer reads it.

    A module whose Stata artifact exists but joins no headline row is also a
    finding, not a pass: it means the Stata column is decorative. Those are
    reported separately so a bridge cannot be counted as coverage while
    comparing nothing.

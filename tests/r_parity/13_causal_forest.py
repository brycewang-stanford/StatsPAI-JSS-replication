"""StatsPAI Causal Forest parity (Python side) -- Module 13.

Headline causal-forest parity on a **clean-overlap** deterministic DGP
with an analytically known average treatment effect.  The companion
``13_causal_forest.R`` reads the identical CSV bytes and runs
``grf::causal_forest`` + ``grf::average_treatment_effect`` for the
``"all"`` (ATE) and ``"treated"`` (ATT) targets.

Why a clean-overlap DGP, not NSW-DW
-----------------------------------
The previous module 13 ran both forests on the NSW + PSID-1 sample,
whose propensity scores span [0.002, 0.993].  In that regime the AIPW
influence function carries 1/e and 1/(1-e) terms that blow up, so
*neither* implementation is reliable and the cross-implementation gap
is an overlap artefact, not a parity fact.  Reporting that gap as a
"parity" row required a 500%-tolerance band, which is not validation.

This module instead uses a propensity bounded in [0.30, 0.70], where
both forests are well-posed and the AIPW ATE/ATT are honestly
estimable.  Both ``sp.causal_forest.average_treatment_effect`` and
``grf::average_treatment_effect`` report the doubly-robust AIPW
estimand, so they are like-for-like and must agree within combined
Monte Carlo error (the two engines use independent RNGs and bespoke
nuisance learners, so bit-equality is not expected).  The
overlap-stress behaviour that the old NSW-DW row documented is retained
as the ``sp.causal_forest`` row of the Track B robustness sweep
(``tests/coverage_monte_carlo/test_coverage_robustness.py``).

Registered tolerance (``compare.py``): rel_est < 0.005 on the AIPW
ATE/ATT point estimates -- a conservative envelope around the observed
post-nuisance-regularisation sp-vs-grf gap, sized to combined Monte
Carlo error, not the old 5.0.
